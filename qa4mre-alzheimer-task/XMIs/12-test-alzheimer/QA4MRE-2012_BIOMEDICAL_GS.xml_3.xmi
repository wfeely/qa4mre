Particularly, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer’s disease. The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein (APP) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity. Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block thetransport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. In this paper, we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta. Moreover, we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, elevation of reactive oxygen species production, alteration of mitochondrial dynamics, and interaction with mitochondrial proteins. Thus, this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease, and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease. 1. IntroductionEach year, over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases. This figure is expected to grow by 20% over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer. This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases, cancer, and stroke [1]. The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [2]. The most widely recognized is AD, which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century. Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, 60% of cases being due to AD, which occurs in 1% of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50% of those over 70 years old [3]. Dramatically, these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [4].From the neuropathological point of view, AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss, marked synaptic alteration, morphological mitochondrial abnormalities, and Tau pathology. The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits. The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure. Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD, and more recently, energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD [1–11]. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging, the best established risk factor for AD. Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [12, 13]. Recently, we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase- (X-XOD-) system-induced cell death, and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [14]. In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages (I/0, III-IV, and V-VI), we demonstrated that in AD patients, amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [15], there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), and N-carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL) may result in impaired protein interactions, protein folding, and protein kinase activity; abnormal function of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [16].2. MitochondriaMitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [17]. They are also involved in regulationof cell death via apoptosis, in the control of cell division and growth, in calcium homeostasis, haem biosynthesis, and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters.Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments, distinct by composition and function (Figure 1). The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle. It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances (up to 5000 Da) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase (complex V). Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, EndoG, and Htra2/Omi. In contrast to the permeable outer membrane, the inner mitochondrial membrane, rich in cardiolipin, provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions, including protons. This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area. It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain, the cofactor coenzyme Q, and many mitochondrial carriers. In the matrix, different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [18].324968.fig.001Figure 1: Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure. Scale bar 200 nm.Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own, circular, double-stranded DNA (mtDNA) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes, 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [18, 19]. The remaining genes encode transfer (22 genes) and ribosomal (2 genes) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins. Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins, the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria, including those involved in DNA transcription, translation, and repair, are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol. As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain, it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [20].Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes: Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes (complex I to IV) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V). Complexes I, III, and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins, whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane. The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP. These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors: ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II, respectively. Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II, and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water. As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain, a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential. The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V.3. Amyloid-Beta in the CytosolAccumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss, being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain, the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells. Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [21–23]. The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia.It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin, also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 (LRP2) [24], LRP-1 [22], or RAGE (receptors for advanced glycation end products) [25]. The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons, microglia, and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions. These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular, insoluble plaques. There are many studies proposing that megalin- and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model.4. Amyloid-Beta and MitochondriaStudies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression. Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments: the outer mitochondrial membrane, intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane, and the matrix. It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis, a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle, each accelerating the other, can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis.The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content, its relatively high oxygen metabolism, and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [26]. One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression, before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [27, 28]. Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [29, 30].Free radicals (compounds with an unpaired electron) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism. Mitochondria are the major source of ROS, and, in fact, mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [31]. mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [32]. Quantitative morphometric, molecular, and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [33, 34]. Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD.Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [35–37], suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain. Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [38] and in components of the Krebs cycle, including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [39]. In addition, superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane. H2O2 and superoxide radicals, released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, might be carried to the cytoplasm and, ultimately, might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [26].Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD (Figure 2). Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein (APP) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [30]. Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD: both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins, block mitochondrial import channels, impair mitochondrial transport, disrupt the electron transfer chain, increase ROS levels, and cause mitochondrial damage.324968.fig.002Figure 2: APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients. APP processing occurs by two pathways: a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway. In the nonamyloidogenic pathway (left), cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment (sAPPα) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues (C83). Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by γ-secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide (P3) and APP intracellular domain (ACID). These products are nontoxic. The non-amyloidogenic α-secretase pathway occurs in over 90% of humans, and these individuals generally do not develop dementia. In the amyloidogenic pathway (right), cleavage occurs by β-secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment (sAPPβ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues (C99). This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by"/><tcas:DocumentAnnotation xmi:id="1169" sofa="11" begin="0" end="15474" language="x-unspecified"/><types:TestDocument xmi:id="1174" sofa="11" begin="0" end="0" text="Journal of Aging Research&#10;Volume 2012 (2012), Article ID 324968, 9 pagesdoi:10.1155/2012/324968&#10;Review Article&#10;New Insights in the Amyloid-Beta Interaction with Mitochondria&#10;Carlos Spuch, Saida Ortolano, and Carmen Navarro Department of Pathology and Neuropathology, Hospital of Meixoeiro, University Hospital of Vigo, Meixoeiro s/n, 36215 Vigo, Spain&#10;Received 28 November 2011; Accepted 11 January 2012&#10;Academic Editor: Jan Vijg Copyright © 2012 Carlos Spuch et al.

abnormal function of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [16].2.&#10;Mitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [17].&#10;They are also involved in regulationof cell death via apoptosis, in the control of cell division and growth, in calcium homeostasis, haem biosynthesis, and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters.&#10;Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments, distinct by composition and function (Figure 1).&#10;The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle.&#10;It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances (up to 5000 Da) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase (complex V).&#10;Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, EndoG, and Htra2/Omi.&#10;In contrast to the permeable outer membrane, the inner mitochondrial membrane, rich in cardiolipin, provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions, including protons.&#10;This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area.&#10;It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain, the cofactor coenzyme Q, and many mitochondrial carriers.&#10;In the matrix, different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [18].324968.&#10;Figure 1: Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure.&#10;Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own, circular, double-stranded DNA (mtDNA) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes, 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [18, 19].&#10;The remaining genes encode transfer (22 genes) and ribosomal (2 genes) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins.&#10;Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins, the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria, including those involved in DNA transcription, translation, and repair, are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol.&#10;As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain, it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [20].&#10;Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes: Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).&#10;OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes (complex I to IV) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V).&#10;Complexes I, III, and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins, whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane.&#10;The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP.&#10;These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors: ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II, respectively.&#10;Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II, and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water.&#10;As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain, a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential.&#10;The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V.3.&#10;Amyloid-Beta in the Cytosol&#10;Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss, being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis.&#10;Moreover, previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain, the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells.&#10;Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [21–23].&#10;The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia.&#10;It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin, also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 (LRP2) [24], LRP-1 [22], or RAGE (receptors for advanced glycation end products) [25].&#10;The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons, microglia, and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions.&#10;These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular, insoluble plaques.&#10;There are many studies proposing that megalin- and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model.4.&#10;Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression.&#10;Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally.&#10;Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments: the outer mitochondrial membrane, intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane, and the matrix.&#10;It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis, a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle, each accelerating the other, can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis.&#10;The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content, its relatively high oxygen metabolism, and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [26].&#10;One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression, before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [27, 28].&#10;Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [29, 30].&#10;Free radicals (compounds with an unpaired electron) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism.&#10;Mitochondria are the major source of ROS, and, in fact, mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [31].&#10;mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [32].&#10;Quantitative morphometric, molecular, and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [33, 34].&#10;Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD.&#10;Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [35–37], suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain.&#10;Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [38] and in components of the Krebs cycle, including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [39].&#10;In addition, superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane.&#10;H2O2 and superoxide radicals, released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, might be carried to the cytoplasm and, ultimately, might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [26].&#10;Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD (Figure 2).&#10;Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein (APP) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [30].&#10;Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD: both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins, block mitochondrial import channels, impair mitochondrial transport, disrupt the electron transfer chain, increase ROS levels, and cause mitochondrial damage.324968.&#10;Figure 2: APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients.&#10;APP processing occurs by two pathways: a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway.&#10;In the nonamyloidogenic pathway (left), cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment (sAPPα) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues (C83).&#10;Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by γ-secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide (P3) and APP intracellular domain (ACID).&#10;The non-amyloidogenic α-secretase pathway occurs in over 90% of humans, and these individuals generally do not develop dementia.&#10;In the amyloidogenic pathway (right), cleavage occurs by β-secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment (sAPPβ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues (C99).&#10;This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by&#10;" sentenceList="2991 3254 4035 4420 5457 6028 6443 7436 8761 9176 10565 11564 11925 12568
