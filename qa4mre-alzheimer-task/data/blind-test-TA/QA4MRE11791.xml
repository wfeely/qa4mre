Of mice and men: an Alzheimer’s cure for our murine brethren. Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, and is predicted to affect 1 in 85 people by the year 2050. And unlike stroke, prostate cancer, heart disease, and HIV, diseases in which we have made progress in treating, Alzheimer's disease has been increasing in prevalence as a cause of death. While this is probably partly due to the fact that we have been living longer and Alzheimer's is typically (but not always) a disease of the elderly, there is no denying that Alzheimer's is a disease in need of attention.  There are a few existing Alzheimer's treatments that can provide mild relief of symptoms, but none halt or even slow disease progression. Why have we not been able to come up with an effective treatment for this increasingly common disease? Here's one reason - we're not even sure what causes the disease!  A prime suspect in the disease are amyloid-beta proteins. These proteins may have accomplices that also cause Alzheimer's, but amyloid-beta proteins play a definite, if not starring role. Amyloid-beta proteins are misfolded chunks of another protein, creatively named APP for amyloid precursor protein. I use the word "chunks" because the bits of the protein that misfold and form aggregates are made up of pieces of a larger protein that gets cut up by enzymes, as shown below. What does the full-lenth amyloid precursor do as it's chilling outside the cell, all floppy and blue? (Note: proteins are not actually blue and cartoony as shown in the above figure. They are very tiny.) We don't even know that! We do know that when amyloid-beta begins to misfold, it aggregates with other proteins and that these aggregates probably cause neuron damage. Other neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or Parkinson's are also linked to these aggregates of misfolded proteins, generally called amyloids.  Get out your tarp, because this might blow your mind: what we call protein "misfolding" in Alzheimer's and other diseases may actually be related to the normal activity of these proteins! What else besides protein misfolding and neurodegneration ties together Alzheimer's, CJD, and Parkinson's? We don't know what any of the precursor proteins in those diseases as their normal functions. It COULD (big emphasis on the could) be possible that some of these proteins are meant to be sometimes be folded in the amyloid state, and that these neurodegenerative diseases are caused by an upset in the natural equilibrium of "normally folded" and "misfolded" amyloid states. I plan to blog more on protein folding and amyloids but here's a teaser for another paper I will cover - amyloid proteins may help explain how memory works.  Now that I have not-definitively-at-all covered the background of Alzheimer's, let's get to the paper I want to talk about today. This paper, "ApoE-Directed Therapeutics Rapidly Clear Β-Amyloid and Reverse Deficits in AD Mouse Models," was published in March as a ScienceExpress article. This means that the editors of the journal Science thought it was important enough to rush out and publish online. Added bonus for overworked grad students like myself - ScienceExpress papers are short! Punchline The authors of this paper do something kind of amazing - they find a drug, bexarotene, that they can give to mice with Alzheimer's and almost immediately clear out the deposits of aggregated amyloid-beta protein that build up in the brains of people and mice with Alzheimer's. Even better - this drug is already FDA approved for the treatment of cancer. And as chemotherapy drugs go, its side-effects aren't that bad, so we know we can give it to humans relatively safely.  How amazing is this drug? The authors take images of brain slices from mice pre and post treatment. Aggregates of amyloid-beta can be visualized and counted by adding a florescent antibody. After only three days, the amount of aggregated protein in both the cortex and hippocampus of affected mice has decreased by nearly half, and the decrease continues for several weeks. This is great!  The authors also show that not only do the plaques that may cause the disease dissipate, the mice also experience restored memory and cognition, which would be an amazing result if it holds in humans. In mice, building nests is a social behavior that healthy mice can perform but that Alzheimer's-affected mice cannot. After treatment with bexarotene, nest-making ability in diseased mice was restored. Bexarotene treatment also restores the sense of smell in Alzheimer's mice, another great sign because humans with Alzheimer's also experience loss of smell.  How does the drug work? There is a protein called apoE naturally expressed in your neurons. This protein gets secreted out, attaches itself to amyloid-beta aggregates, and helps break down these aggregates. apoE encourages microglia, helper cells in your brain, to eat up through phagocytosis amyloid-beta aggregates and then to break down the aggregates. Everyone's brain, even in people with Alzheimer's, already makes apoE and breaks down amyloid-beta aggregates. Alzheimer's could be caused by an inability to break down amyloid-beta fast enough (like healthy people do), so making more apoE could reverse the disease. So we have a cure for Alzheimer's right? Right! ... for mice. Anyone who's ever read about an amazing cure for a disease found in mice already knows that this cure is not likely to work in humans. Although mice have versions of 99% of the proteins we have, we also share a majority of our genome with plants. And as much as I try, laying in the sun does not make me full, just sleepy and full of vitamin D, so simply sharing similar genes does not make me the same as a mouse or plant. It's particularly tricky to translate a therapy for a neurodegenerative disease from mice to humans, since we think so differently than they do, at least based on my conversations with mice.  A further complication are the mice we perform Alzheimer's research on. In order to do this research, scientists had to create mice that could serve as models for the human disease. This was done by inserting in human genes that cause Alzheimer's, creating an imperfect model. Mice models of disease do not show all of the symptoms that humans with Alzheimer's do and may in fact be better models for early stages of disease progression than late. If so, bexarotene may be able to be used as a preventative therapy, but not as a cure.  Even with these grains of salt in mind, I still found this paper very exciting. I look forward to seeing what the results of ongoing clinical trials of bexarotene as an Alzheimer's therapy in humans will be. With a little luck, this drug can succeed where so many other promising drugs in mice have failed and become a useful therapy in humans.  If a loved one of mine had Alzheimer's, I would be watching the clinical trial results very closely.

Next Section AbstractImpaired brain glucose uptake and metabolism precede the appearance of clinical symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD). Neuronal glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) is decreased in AD brain and correlates with tau pathology. However, what leads to the decreased GLUT3 is yet unknown. In this study, we found that the promoter of human GLUT3 contains three potential cAMP response element (CRE)-like elements, CRE1, CRE2 and CRE3. Overexpression of CRE-binding protein (CREB) or activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase significantly increased GLUT3 expression. CREB bound to the CREs and promoted luciferase expression driven by human GLUT3-promoter. Among the CREs, CRE2 and CRE3 were required for the promotion of GLUT3 expression. Full-length CREB was decreased and truncation of CREB was increased in AD brain. This truncation was correlated with calpain I activation in human brain. Further study demonstrated that calpain I proteolysed CREB at Gln28–Ala29 and generated a 41-kDa truncated CREB, which had less activity to promote GLUT3 expression. Importantly, human brain GLUT3 was correlated with full-length CREB positively and with activation of calpain I negatively. These findings suggest that overactivation of calpain I caused by calcium overload proteolyses CREB, resulting in a reduction of GLUT3 expression and consequently impairing glucose uptake and metabolism in AD brain. Previous SectionNext Section INTRODUCTIONOne of the main features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the severe reduction of glucose uptake and metabolism in the specific brain areas (1–4). In vivo imaging demonstrates consistent and progressive reduction of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose in AD patients (5–8). This reduction correlates with the severity of clinical symptom of AD (9–11). Importantly, glucose metabolic reduction has been observed before the onset of the disease in several groups of at risk individuals, including patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (12), pre-symptomatic individuals carrying mutations for early-onset familial AD (13–15), normal and middle-aged carriers of apolipoprotein E4 (16–20) and in those with a maternal family history of AD (21,22). These studies strongly suggest that the impairment of glucose uptake/metabolism is a cause of neurodegeneration or is mechanistically involved in the pathogenesis of AD. It is well known that neurons mainly depend on glucose as a fuel for providing energy and glucose cannot be synthesized by or stored in the neuron. Brain neurons take glucose from blood stream. However, glucose cannot pass through the blood–brain barrier or cell membrane freely and requires glucose transporters (GLUTs) to assistant the transport. To date, 14 members of GLUTs have been reported in the human tissue (23). Among them, GLUT3 is the major neuronal GLUT and determines the efficiency of glucose transport into the neuron (24). The level of GLUT3 correlates positively with regional cerebral glucose utilization (25–27). GLUT3, different from other GLUTs, has a higher affinity for glucose and at least 5-fold greater transport capacity (28), which allows it to transport glucose effectively even when its level is very low. In AD brain, GLUT3 level is decreased (29,30) and correlated with the extent of hyperphosphorylation of tau and with the density of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD (31). However, what leads to the decrease in GLUT3 in AD brain remains elusive. It has been reported that the expression of the mouse GLUT3 gene may be regulated by several transcription factors, including HIF-1 (32), Sp1, Sp3 (33,34) and cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) (34). However, the regulation of human GLUT3 expression is not well understood. To understand the mechanism of GLUT3 expression, we analyzed the promoter of human GLUT3 and found that it contains three CRE-like elements. CREB is originally described as a transcription factor that binds to an 8-bp element, TGACGTCA, known as a CRE, in the somatostatin gene promoter (35). Upon binding to CRE, CREB regulates the expression of target genes. CREB is composed of a C-terminal promoter-binding domain and an N-terminal transcription regulation domain, in which PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) phosphorylates Ser133 (36). Importantly, Ser133 phosphorylation is required for its activity to regulate gene expression (37). In this study, we investigated the regulation of GLUT3 expression by CREB and found that CREB bound to the promoter region of human GLUT3 and regulated its expression. In AD brain, CREB was truncated due to proteolysis by calpain I and the truncated form of CREB had less activity to promote GLUT3 expression, which resulted in a reduction of GLUT3 expression, leading to impaired glucose uptake and metabolism. These results provide a novel insight into the pathogenesis of AD. Previous SectionNext Section MATERIALS AND METHODSHuman brain tissuesFrontal cortices from seven AD and seven age-matched normal human brains used for this study (Table 1) were obtained from the Sun Health Research Institute Donation Program (Sun City, AZ, USA). All brain samples were confirmed histopathologically and stored at −70°C until used. The use of frozen human brain tissue was in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and was approved by our institute’s institutional review committee.

Maltose-binding protein (MBP)-CREB, Magna CHIP™A/G kit, polyclonal anti-CREB (against amino acid 5–24) and monoclonal anti-PP2A catalytic subunit were purchased from Millipore/Merck KgaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Polyclonal anti-GLUT3 and anti-GAPDH were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). RL2 was bought from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO, USA). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA, USA). ECL Kit was from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL, USA), and [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ, USA). Cell culture and transfectionHEK-293T cells (ATCC, Manassa, VA, USA) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37°C. SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C. Differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC) was induced by 10 µM all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA) for 3 days (for transfection) or 7 days (for forskolin treatment). All transfections were performed in triplicate with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or FuGENE HD (Roch Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to manufacturer’s manuals. Reverse-transcription PCR and real-time quantitative PCRTotal RNA was isolated from the frontal cortical or from cultured cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and used for first-strand cDNA synthesis with Oligo-(dT)15–18 by using the RT2 First-Strand Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA of GLUT3 or GAPDH was amplified by PCR using PrimeSTARTM HS DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan) at 98°C for 3 min, 98°C for 10 s and at 68°C for 40 s for 30 cycles and then at 68°C for 10 min for extension. The PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels and visiblized by using the Molecular Imager system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). For quantitative PCR (qPCR), cDNA of GLUT3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and GAPDH were amplified by using Brilliant II SYBR® Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies, Inc. Santa Clara, CA, USA) in a Agilent Mx3000p PCR detection system under the condition: 95°C for 10 min, 95°C for 30 s and 60°C for 1 min, for 40 cycles. Relative levels of target mRNAs were calculated by the comparative CT (threshold cycle) method (2−ΔΔCT). The PCR specificity was examined by 3% agarose gel using 5 µl from each reaction. The primers used for this study are as follows: GLUT3 forward 5′TCCCCTCCGCTGCTCACTATTT3′ and reverse 5′ATCTCCATGA CGCCGTCCTTTC3′; BDNF forward 5′GCCTTTGGAGCCTCCTCTTCTC3′ and reverse 5′TTTTT GTCTGCCGCCGTTACCC3′; GAPDH forward 5′GGTGGTCTCCTCTGACTTCAACA3′ and reverse 5′GTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGTTGT3′. Plasmid construction of luciferase reporter driven by human GLUT3 promoter and luciferase assayA ∼2.2-kb fragment of the human GLUT3 genomic DNA from −2000 to +241 bp was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGL3-basic (Promega) by Kpn I and Xho I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) to generate pGL3/GLUT3−2000. Subsequently, serial deletion mutations and site mutations of CRE2 and CRE3 of pGL3/GLUT3 constructs were generated by using a PCR-based strategy employing primers listed in Table 2. The sequence and orientation of the individual clones were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. View this table: In this windowIn a new windowTable 2. List of primers used for generating mutated promoter of GLUT3 constructsHEK-293T cells were co-transfected with pCI/CREB, pGL3/GLUT3 or their control vectors and pRL-Tk for 48 h. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with these plasmids under differentiation condition (culture medium containing 10 µM ATRA). The cells were lysed using 0.1 ml of passive lysis buffer (Promega). The luciferase activity was measured by the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to manufacturer’s manuals. The firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity were measured subsequently and the firefly luciferase activity was normalized with Renilla luciferase activity. ImmunoprecipitationHEK-293T cells were transfected with pCI/HA-CREB for 48 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with lysate buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM AEBSF, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin and 10 µg/ml pepstatin). After the insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with anti-HA pre-conjugated protein G beads overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed with lysate buffer twice and with TBS twice, and bound proteins were subjected to further studies. In vitro proteolysis of CREB For the proteolysis of CREB in the brain extract, we homogenized human brain tissue in nine volumes of buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 8.5% sucrose, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2.0 mM EDTA, followed by centrifugation at 15 000g at 4°C for 10 min. The obtained supernatants were incubated in the presence or absence of various concentrations of Ca2+ and/or protease inhibitors for 10 min at 30°C. The reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli buffer, followed by boiling in water for 5 min. The proteolysed products were analyzed by western blots developed with antibodies against calpain I and CREB. For the proteolysis of purified CREB by calpain I in vitro, we incubated recombinant MBP–CREB or immunopurified HA-CREB from CREB-transfected-HEK-293T cells as described above with various concentrations of calpain I (Sigma, USA) in proteolysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl2) for 10 min at 30°C. The proteolysed products were subjected to further studies. Chromatin immunoprecipitationSH-SY5Y cells were transfected with pCI/HA-CREB for 72 h under differentiation condition and subjected for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) by using Magna ChIPTM A/G kit (Millipore) according to manufacturer’s manuals. Briefly, the cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and terminated by adding glycine solution to incubate for 5 min. After washing with ice-cold PBS containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, the cells were lysed with Lysis Buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail on ice 15 min. The crude nuclei fraction was collected by centrifugation at 800g for 5 min at 4°C. The nuclei were suspended with Nuclear Lysis Buffer and sonicated to break DNA to ∼200–450 bp. The debris was removed by centrifugation at 10 000g for 10 min at 4°C. After adding Dilution Buffer into the supernatant, anti-HA or normal mouse IgG and proteinA/G magnetic beads were added into the supernatant and incubated for 1 h at 4°C with rotation. The ProteinA/G magnetic bead-antibody/chromatin complex was extensively washed sequentially with low-salt wash buffer, high-salt wash buffer, LiCl wash buffer and TE, and eluted with Elution Buffer with proteinase K. The cross-linking was reversed by incubation at 62°C for 2 h and at 95°C for 10 min and the supernatant was collected carefully. The total DNA was extracted from the supernatant with Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). CRE1, CRE2 and CRE3 containing sequences were amplified with PCR by using three sets of primers, set 1 (forward 5′TATTTTCTTCTCCTGCTTAGCT3′, reverse 5′AGTCATT TATAGTGTTTCCCTTC3′), set 2 (forward, 5′CCCAGGGTGGAGAGAGTGGAAG3′, reverse 5′TTATAATCTCCGCAAAGGGTGGAG3′) and set 3 (forward 5′GTCATATCCCAGCGAGACCC AG3′, reverse 5′C GCTGTAATCTAATTCAAGTCTTCAAG3′), respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assayCREB expressed HEK-293T cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and cocktail of protease inhibitors) on ice for 20 min, and then pellet from 15 000g for 3 min centrifugation was suspended in the buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol and 1 mM DTT. Nucleic proteins were extracted by centrifugation at 15 000g for 10 min. Complementary double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) oligomers containing CRE1 (5′CAGATACT TATGTAACACTTTT3′ and 5′AAAGTGTTACATAAGTATTG3′), CRE2 (5′GGAGGGAGGGCGTT ATTGTCT3′ and 5′AGACAAAACGCCCTCCCTCC3′), CRE3 (5′TCCTGAGGACGTGGAGAAAA C3′ and 5′GTTTTCTCCACGTCCTCAGGA3′) and CRE consensus sequence (5′TCAGCCTGAC GTCATACATCG3′ and 5′CGATGTATGACGTCAGGCTGA3′) as a positive control were annealed and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mM) (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, USA) and subsequently purified with MicroSpin G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). Then above nucleic proteins were mixed with 32P-labeled double-stranded CRE1, CRE2, CRE3 or CRE consensus sequence. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 40 min and subjected to 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel pre-run at 100 V for 10 min. After electrophoresis with TBE buffer (89 mM Tris–borate, 2 mM EDTA) at 100 V for 60 min, the gel was dried and autoradiographed with a PhosphorImager (BAS-1500, Fujifilm, Japan). N-terminal sequencingRecombinant MBP–CREB was proteolysed by calpain I as described earlier. The reaction products were separated by 10% SDS–PAGE and electric blotted onto a PVDF membrane. After staining with Coomassie blue, the 41-kDa truncated CREB was dissected and subjected for N-terminal Edman Sequencing by Protein facility-Protein Sequencing Service, Iowa State University of Science and Technology. Statistical analysisWhere appropriate, the data are presented as mean ± SD. Data points were compared with the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, and the calculated P-values are indicated in the figures. For the analysis of the correlation between CREB truncation and calpain I activation or GLUT3 level in human brain homogenates, the Pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated. Previous SectionNext Section RESULTSCREB promotes the expression of GLUT3GLUT3 protein level is decreased in AD brain (29–31). Here, we measured GLUT3 mRNA levels by qPCR in frontal cortices from six AD and six control cases. We observed that GLUT3 mRNA was significantly decreased in AD brain (Figure 1A), suggesting that the transcription of GLUT3 is down-regulated in AD brain. Figure 1.

Total RNA was extracted from frontal cortices of AD and control cases. The levels of GLUT3 and GAPDH mRNA were measured by qPCR and presented as means ± SD (n = 12); **P &lt; 0.01. (B) Human GLUT3 promoter region has three potential CRE-like elements. The promoter of human GLUT3 was analyzed by Matlnspector software. Cis-elements are labeled with different color and gray boxes show the overlap sequences of two adjacent elements. There are three CRE-like elements at the promoter region of human GLUT3. Other transcriptional factors are ETS (E-26), Sp1 (Specificity Protein 1) and EGR (early growth response protein 1). (C) Activation of PKA enhanced the GLUT3 expression. SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated with ATRA for 7 days and treated with various concentration of forskolin for 10 h. The total RNA was extracted and amplified to measure mRNA expressions of GLUT3, BDNF and GAPDH by qPCR. (D, E) Overexpression of CREB increased the expression of GLUT3 mRNA. SH-SY5Y cells under differentiation condition were transfected with pCI/CREB and empty plasmid (Con) for 3 days and the mRNA levels of GLUT3 and GAPDH were measured by qPCR (D) and regular PCR products of GLUT3 mRNA with same primers were subjected to agarose electrophoresis (E). The level of GLUT3 mRNA was presented as mean ± SD (n = 3); **P &lt; 0.01. To understand the molecular mechanism of GLUT3 expression regulation, we first analyzed the promoter of the human GLUT3 gene by MatInspector software analysis (40,41), a Genomatix internationally renowned program for the identification of transcription factor-binding sites. The bioinformatic analysis revealed an array of putative nuclear factor-binding sites including three potential CRE-like elements, namely CRE1, CRE2 and CRE3 (Figure 1B), which may be the binding sites of CREB. Activation of CREB is dependent on its phosphorylation at Ser133 by activated PKA (37). So, we determined whether PKA/CREB regulates human GLUT3 expression. We used SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and differentiated them to neuronal-like cells with 10 µM ATRA for 7 days. Then, the cells were treated with various concentrations of forskolin for 10 h to activate PKA. The total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcripted to cDNA and subjected to qPCR to measure the level of GLUT3 mRNA. Because BDNF expression is regulated by CREB, we included it in this study as a positive control. The results showed that forskolin treatment promoted the expressions of BDNF and GLUT3 dose dependently (Figure 1C) but with a stronger effect on GLUT3 expression. The highest expression of GLUT3 was induced by 5 µM forskolin treatment (Figure 1C). This result supports our hypothesis that PKA/CREB may promote GLUT3 expression. To explore the role of CREB on human GLUT3 expression, we overexpressed CREB in SH-SY5Y cells for 3 days under the differentiation condition. The level of GLUT3 mRNA was measured by qPCR (Figure 1D). Similarly, the cDNA was amplified by PCR with the same primers as that used for qPCR, and the products were also subjected to agarose electrophoresis (Figure 1E). We observed that an increased level of GLUT3 mRNA was induced by overexpression of CREB (Figure 1D and E), suggesting that CREB enhances the expression of GLUT3. CREB binds to CRE1, CRE2 and CRE3 and promotes the expression of luciferase driven by GLUT3 promoter There are three CREs in human GLUT3 promoter. We first measured the binding of CREB to CRE1 (−1631 to −1610 bp), CRE2 (−116 to −95 bp) and CRE3 (+101 bp to +121 bp) (Figure 2A) by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). We incubated the nuclear extracts of CREB-expressing HEK-293T cells with 32P-labeled DNA probes of CRE1, CRE2 or CRE3. The reaction mixtures were applied for native gel electrophoresis. We observed a mobility shift up of CRE-1, CRE-2 or CRE-3 induced by adding CREB containing nuclear extract, suggesting the formation of protein–CRE (1, 2 or 3) complex (Figure 2B). However, this mobility shift was detected when the total protein of nuclear extract reached to 10 µg, whereas only 5 µg nuclear extract was needed to completely shift the positive control consensus CRE (Figure 2B), suggesting that protein(s) in the extract could bind to the CREs but are weaker than the positive-control CRE.

CREB binds to the CRE-like elements in human GLUT3 promoter and promotes the luciferase expression driven by this promoter. (A) Schematic diagram of three CRE-like elements in GLUT3 promoter and its luciferase reporter. (B) CREB bound to three CRE-like elements detected by EMSA. 32P-labeled consensus CRE (Con) as a positive control and three CRE-like elements, CRE1, CRE2 and CRE3, of human GLUT3 promoter were incubated with the nuclear extracts (5 µg for consensus CRE and 10 µg for three CRE-like elements) in the absence or presence of anti-CREB or anti-P-CREB and subjected to native PAGE. The gel was dried and autoradiographed with a PhosphorImager (BAS-1500, Fijifilm, Japan). (C) CRE-like elements in human GLUT3 promoter were co-immunoprecipitated with CREB by ChIP assay. SH-SY5Y cells under differentiation condition were transfected with pCI/CREB and then CREB was immunoprecipitated by anti-HA. Three CRE-like elements in the immune-complexes were amplified by PCR using the primers specific to CRE1, CRE2 or CRE3. The PCR products were quantified by densitometry and presented as mean ± SD (n = 3); **P &lt; 0.01. (D) Forskolin treatment enhanced the binding of CREB with the CRE of GLUT3 promoter. SH-SY5Y cells under differentiation condition were transfected with pCI/CREB, treated with forskolin for 10 h and then CREB was immunoprecipitated by anti-HA. The three CREs were amplified by PCR with their specific primers. (E) Promoter of human GLUT3 promoted luciferase expression. Human GLUT3 promoter (−2000 to +241) was inserted into pGL3-basic vector to generate pGL3/GLUT3−2000. pGL3/GLUT3−2000 or its control pGL3 showed in panel A was co-transfected with pRL-TK into HEK-293T cells for 48 h. The firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity were measured subsequently and the firefly luciferase activity was normalized with Renilla luciferase activity and presented as mean ± SD (n = 3); **P &lt; 0.01. (F) CREB enhanced GLUT3 promoter-driving luciferase expression. pGL3/GLUT3−2000 and pRL-TK was co-transfected with pCI (Con) or pCI/CREB into HEK-293T cells for 48 h. The luciferase activity was measured and presented as mean ± SD (n = 3); **P &lt; 0.01. To validate the binding of CREB to the CREs, we added anti-CREB or anti-pS133-CREB into the incubation mixtures. We observed that addition of anti-CREB or anti-pS133-CREB antibody into the mixture containing control CRE induced a super-shift (Figure 2B). However, addition of these two antibodies into the mixture containing CRE1, CRE2 or CRE3 abolished the shift (CREB-CRE) induced by the nuclear extracts (Figure 2B), suggesting that CREB binds weakly but specifically to the three CREs, which are located in the promoter region of human GLUT3 gene. To confirming the binding of CREB onto the CREs of human GLUT3 promoter, we performed ChIP in SH-SY5Y cells. CREB tagged with HA at its N-terminus was expressed in SH-SY5Y cells and immunoprecipitated by anti-HA. DNA in the immunocomplex was amplified by PCR using three sets of primers covering CRE1, CRE2 and CRE3, respectively. We observed that significant amount of CRE1, CRE2 or CRE3 was detected in the immunocomplex of anti-HA (Figure 2C), indicating the binding of CREB with these three CREs. We further determined the effect of PKA activation by forskolin on the binding of CREB with CREs. We treated CREB-expressing-SH-SY5Y cells with 10 mM forskolin for 10 h and then carried out the ChIP with anti-HA. We found that forskolin treatment enhanced the binding of CREB with the CREs in human GLUT3 promoter (Figure 2D). Thus, these data confirm that CREB acts on the three CREs in the promoter region of the human GLUT3 gene and PKA activation enhances the binding. Our above results have shown that CREB specifically bound to the CREs in the promoter of human GLUT3 gene in vitro and in intact cells. It is possible that CREB acts on the promoter to regulate the transcription of human GLUT3 gene. To test this possibility, we inserted the promoter region of human GLUT3, −2000 to +241, into pGL3 basic vector to generate reporter plasmid of pGL3/GLUT3−2000 (Figure 2A). We transfected pGL3/GLUT3−2000 and pRL-Tk into HEK-293T cells and then measured luciferase activity by the dual luciferase assay. We found that promoter of human GLUT3 increased luciferase activity by ∼100-fold (Figure 2E), indicating that the promoter of human GLUT3 drives the luciferase expression. By using this luciferase reporter, hence, we test the promotion of GLUT3 expression by CREB. We co-transfected pCI/CREB or pCI with pGL3/GLUT3−2000 and pRL-Tk into HEK-293T cells and measured the luciferase activity 48 h after transfection. We observed an ∼3-fold elevation in luciferase activity in pCI/CREB-transfected HEK-293T cells when compared with the control transfected cells (Figure 2F), suggesting that CREB enhances the expression of luciferase driven by GLUT3 promoter. Thus, CREB may act onto the CRE elements of GLUT3 promoter to promote the expression of human GLUT3. CRE2 and CRE3 are responsible for the promotion of GLUT3 expressionTo verify the regulation of GLUT3 expression by the three CREs in the promoter region of human GLUT3, we constructed luciferase reporter plasmids, pGL3/GLUT3, with sequential deletion mutants of human GLUT3 promoter (Figure 3A, left). The generated plasmids were transfected into HEK-293T cells. The luciferase activity was determined and used to present the expression level of GLUT3. We observed that the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with pGL3/GLUT3−2000, pGL3/GLUT3−1580, pGL3/GLUT3−1000 or pGL3/GLUT3−500 was almost at the same level (Figure 3A, right), indicating that CRE1 is not required for the promotion of GLUT3 expression. The luciferase activity in cells transfected with pGL3/GLUT3+1, in which another 500-bp DNA, including CRE2, was deleted, was reduced by ∼6-fold (Figure 3A, right), suggesting that CRE2 plays a significant role in promoting GLUT3 expression. The luciferase activity in the cells transfected with pGL3/GLUT3+1, which contained CRE3, was much higher than that of pGL3 (Figure 3A, right), suggesting that CRE3 may also act as a transcription enhancer of GLUT3. Figure 3. View larger version: In this windowIn a new windowDownload as PowerPoint SlideFigure 3. CRE2 and CRE3 act as transcription enhancer of human GLUT3. (A, B) From −126 to +122 of human GLUT3 promoter was required for its promotion activity. Sequential deletions of the promoter region of GLUT3 were cloned into pGL3-basic plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene and the plasmids were co-transfected with pRL-TK into HEK-293T cells. The luciferase activity was measured, normalized with Renilla luciferase and presented as mean ± SD (n = 3); **P &lt; 0.01. (C) Mutations of CRE2 and CRE3 used in this study. (D) CRE2 and CRE3 of human GLUT3 promoter were required for its promotion activity. pGL3/GLUT3−2000 carrying different mutations described in panel C were co-transfected with pRL-TK into HEK-293T cells for 48 h, and then the luciferase activity was measured and presented as mean ± SD (n = 3); **P &lt; 0.01. To confirm the role of CRE2 and CRE3 in promoting GLUT3 gene expression, we created more detailed deletions of GLUT3 promoter from −500 to +122 (Figure 3B, left). We found that the luciferase activity decreased significantly when the region from −126 to −85 containing CRE2 was deleted (Figure 3B). Further deletion of −85 to +1 decreased more luciferase activity (Figure 3B), suggesting the involvement of other enhancers at this region in the regulation of GLUT3 expression. Deletion of +1 to +122 containing CRE3 almost abolished the luciferase activity (Figure 3B), indicating a role of CRE3 in promoting GLUT3 expression. Following, we specified the role of CRE2 and CRE3 in the promotion of GLUT3 expression. We mutated CRE2 and CRE3 (Figure 3C) and measured their effect on the luciferase activity. We found that M1 and M4 mutations of CRE2 did not affect the activity of luciferase, but M2 and M3 mutations of CRE2 caused reduction of luciferase activity (Figure 3D). Similarly, mutation of CRE3 significantly decreased luciferase activity (Figure 3D). These results confirmed the role of CRE2 and CRE3 in the promotion of GLUT3 expression. PKA/CREB promotes the expression of luciferase driven by human GLUT3 promoterWe have shown that PKA/CREB regulates endogenous GLUT3 expression. So, we investigated the regulation of PKA/CREB on luciferase expression. We transfected pGL3/GLUT3−2000 (Figure 4A) or pGL3/GLUT3−126 (Figure 4B) into SH-SY5Y cells under differentiation and treated the cells with forskolin for 10 h. The luciferase activity was measured at total 48 h after transfection. We observed that forskolin treatment enhanced luciferase activity in both pGL3/GLUT3−2000 (Figure 4A) and pGL3/GLUT3−126 (Figure 4B) transfected cells, supporting that PKA promotes GLUT3 expression. Figure 4. View larger version: In this windowIn a new windowDownload as PowerPoint SlideFigure 4. PKA/CREB enhances GLUT3 promoter driving-luciferase expression. (A, B) Activation of PKA increased luciferase expression. pGL3/GLUT3−2000 (A) or pGL3/GLUT3−126 (B) was co-transfected with pRL-TK into SH-SY5Y cells and treated with various concentration of forskolin for 10 h. The luciferase activity was measured and presented as mean ± SD (n = 3); **P &lt; 0.01. (C, D) CREB enhanced luciferase expression. HEK-293FT (C) or SH-SY5Y cells (D) were co-transfected with pGL3/GLUT3s and pCI/CREB and pRL-TK. Luciferase activity was measured and presented as mean ± SD (n = 3); **P &lt; 0.01. (E) CREBS133A had much less activity in the promotion of GLUT3 expression. pCI/CREB or pCI/CREBS133A was co-transfected with pGL3/GLUT3−126 into SH-SY5Y cells, and the luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. The relative activity of luciferase was presented as mean ± SD (n = 3); **P &lt; 0.01. (F) Activation of PKA increased O-GlcNAcyaltion. Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were treated with various concentrations of forskolin for 10 h. Total proteins were analyzed by western blots developed with antibodies as indicated. GAPDH was included as a loading control. We next determined the role of CREB on luciferase expression driven by varied lengths of the GLUT3-promoter. We co-expressed pGL3/GLUT3s with CREB in HEK-293T cells and then measured the luciferase activity 48 h after transfection. We found that CREB enhanced the expression of pGL3/GLUT3−2000, pGL3/GLUT3−1580 and pGL3/GLUT3−126 similarly but not pGL3/GLUT3+122 (Figure 4C). We observed similar results in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 4D). These data further confirm that PKA/CREB works on the promoter of GLUT3 to promote its expression. Ser133 phosphorylation is required for CREB transcriptional activity. Thus, we mutated serine 133 to alanine (CREBS133A) and then co-transfected with the pGL3/GLUT3−126 into SH-SY5Y cells under differentiation condition for 48 h and measured the luciferase activity. We found that CREBS133A elevated luciferase activity but much weaker than wild-type CREB (Figure 4E), suggesting that phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 enhances the promotion of GLUT3 expression. Increased intracellular glucose generally leads to upregulation of protein O-GlcNAcylation by providing donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc derived from glucose (42–44). To determine whether the increased expression of GLUT3 by PKA/CREB has physiological activity to transport more glucose into cells, we measured the O-GlcNAcylation of global protein to present intracellular glucose level. We found that forskolin treatment significantly increased O-GlcNAcylation of global proteins determined by anti-RL2 (Figure 4F), coinciding with increased CREB phosphorylation (Figure 4F) and GLUT3 expression (Figure 1C). Thus, GLUT3 expression induced by PKA/CREB facilitates to transport glucose and sequentially leads to increased global protein O-GlcNAcylation. Full-length CREB is decreased and truncated CREB is increased in AD brainAbove results indicate that CREB involves in the regulation of GLUT3 expression, and decreased GLUT3 in AD brain may result from altered CREB signaling in AD. Hence, we measured CREB levels in the homogenates of the frontal cortices from seven AD and seven age- and post-mortem interval-matched control brains by western blots. We found that CREB level detected by anti-CREB against 5–24 amino acids was dramatically decreased in AD brain (Figure 5A and B). To further confirm this phenomenon, we employed another antibody against middle region of CREB to perform the western blot. We observed a similar decrease of full-length CREB at 45-kDa and an increased 41-kDa band in AD brain, without a change total level of CREB (Figure 5A). These results suggest that the truncation of CREB is increased in AD brain (Figure 5A and B). Figure 5. View larger version: In this windowIn a new windowDownload as PowerPoint SlideFigure 5. The level of full-length CREB is decreased in AD brain and is correlated to activation of calpain I in human brain. (A) Western blots of CREB, calpain I and CaN A. Frontal cortical homogenates from seven AD and seven control cases were subjected to western blots developed with antibodies against CREB, calpain I, CaN A or GAPDH. (B) The level of full-length CREB was decreased and truncation of CREB was increased in AD brain significantly. Blots as shown in (A) developed with anti-CREB (upper panel) were quantitated by densitometry, and the levels of CREB was normalized with GAPDH and presented as mean ± SD; *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01. (C) Truncation and activation of calpain I were significantly increased in AD brain. Arrow indicates full length of calpain I and vertical line indicates truncated and active form of calpain I. Blots as shown in (A) developed with anti-calpain I were quantitated by densitometry, the truncation and activation of calpain I were presented by the ratio of the truncated (76–78 kDa) over the total calpain I. (D) CREB level was correlated with the activation of calpain I in human brain. The relative activation of calpain I [truncated/(full length + truncated)] (x-axis) is plotted against the relative CREB level (y-axis). Calpain I is activated by calcium-dependent autoproteolysis from an 80-kDa inactive form into a 76- to 78-kDa active form (45). This process is increased in AD (46,47). So, we determined calpain I activation (ratio of truncated/total calpain I) in these brain samples and performed Pearson correlation analysis. In addition, calcinurine A (CaN), a well-known substrate of calpain I (44), was included in this study (Figure 5A). We observed a marked increase in calpain I activation in AD brain (Figure 5A and C), and this activation was highly and negatively correlated with full-length CREB with a correlation coefficient r = 0.8894 (P &lt; 0.001) in human brain (Figure 5D), suggesting that calpain I activation might underlie the increased truncation of CREB in AD brain. Calpain I is responsible for the truncation of CREBCalpain I is a calcium-dependent neutral protease. To determine whether CREB truncation in human brain is indeed caused by activated calpain I, we incubated normal human brain extracts in the presence of various concentration of calcium for 10 min at 30°C and detected the levels of calpain I and CREB by western blots. We found that calpain I was proteolysed from 80 to 78 and 76 kDa in a Ca2+ dose-dependent manner (Figure 6A, upper panel), suggesting that calcium initiates the autoproteolysis and activation of calpain I. Concurrently, the 45-kDa CREB detected by anti-N-terminal CREB was significantly decreased in a calcium concentration-dependent manner (Figure 6A, middle panel). As an alternative, we added recombinant MBP–CREB fusion protein into the proteolysis reaction and performed in vitro proteolysis, followed by western blots to detect the proteolysed products. We observed a calcium dose-dependent increase in the 52-kDa band detected by anti-N-terminal CREB (Figure 6A, middle panel). However, PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2A–C) in human brain extract was not proteolysed (Figure 6A, lower panel). Because MBP was fused at N-terminus of CREB, this 52-kDa band represented the fusion protein of MBP (∼43 kDa) plus the N-terminal fragment of CREB. Thus, this result further confirms that CREB is proteolysed by a calcium-dependent protease(s) in human extract and the truncation site might be located at its N-terminus. Figure 6. View larger version: In this windowIn a new windowDownload as PowerPoint SlideFigure 6. Proteolysis of CREB is catalyzed by calcium-mediated truncation/activation of calpain I. (A) In vitro proteolyses of calpain I and CREB in human brain extracts were activated by calcium. A normal human brain extract was incubated for 10 min at 30°C in the absence (upper two panels) or presence (3th panel) of recombinant MBP–CREB and analyzed by western blots. PP2A catalytic subunit was used as negative control. (B) Calcium-activated proteolysis of calpain I and CREB was inhibited by calpain inhibitors selectively. Recombinant MBP–CREB was incubated with normal human brain extract in the presence of EGTA or CaCl2 plus various selective protease inhibitors for 10 min at 30°C, followed by western blots to detect the proteolysis. Abbreviations: Apr, aprotinin; Pep, pepstatin; Leu, leupeptin; Calp, calpastatin peptide. (C) Immunopurified CREB from mammalian cells was proteolysed by calpain I. HA-CREB was immunopurified from HEK-293FT cells and incubated with various concentrations of calpain I for 10 min at 30°C. The reaction products were analyzed with western blots. (D–F) Recombinant MBP–CREB was proteolysed by calpain I. Recombinant MBP–CREB was incubated with various concentrations of calpain I for 10 min at 30°C. The proteolytic products were analyzed by Coomassie blue staining (D) and western blots developed with anti-CREB (against amino acids 5–24) (E) or anti-CREB (against middle region) (F). Because the above incubation was carried out in the presence of 2.0 mM EDTA that chelated all endogenous Ca2+ when no additional Ca2+ was added and most of the added Ca2+ that allowed only free Ca2+ &gt; 2.0 mM chelating capacity of EDTA, only micromolar levels of free Ca2+ were present in the reaction mixture during incubation of the brain extracts. Hence, these results suggest that the CREB proteolysis in the human brain extracts resulted from activation of calpain I rather than calpain II, which requires millimolar concentrations of free calcium for activation. We next verified above proteolysis of CREB in human brain extract is caused by calpain. Calpain I is a cysteine protease. So, we performed proteolysis of MBP–CREB in vitro in the presence of various protease inhibitors. When aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor, and pepstatin, an aspartic protease inhibitor, were included in the normal human brain extracts during incubation, no significant inhibition of the proteolysis of either calpain I or CREB was observed (Figure 5B). These results excluded the involvement of serine proteases and aspartic proteases in the proteolysis of calpain I and CREB. In contrast, when leupeptin, a selective inhibitor of cysteine and serine proteases, and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN), a calpain and cysteine protease inhibitor, were included in the incubation mixtures, a marked inhibition of calpain I proteolysis and an almost complete blockage of CREB proteolysis were observed (Figure 5B). A specific calpain inhibitor, calpepstatin peptide, also inhibited the autoproteolysis of calpain I and prevented CREB proteolysis. These results are consistent with the above studies that CREB is proteolysed by calcium-dependent cleavage/activation of calpain I. To confirm CREB is proteolysed by calpain I, we overexpressed HA-tagged CREB at N-terminus in HEK-293FT cells and immunopurified HA-CREB with anti-HA. The immunopurified HA-CREB was incubated with various concentration of calpain I and subjected to western blots using anti-HA and anti-CREB. We observed a decrease of CREB in dose-dependent manner (Figure 6C), suggesting that CREB is cleaved by calpain I in vitro. No specific amino acid sequence is uniquely recognized by calpain (45). To address the cleavage of CREB by calpain I, we incubated purified calpain I with recombinant MBP–CREB and detected the proteolysed products with coomassie blue staining (Figure 6D) and western blots by using anti-N-terminal CREB (Figure 6E) or anti-middle region of CREB (Figure 6F). We observed that, similar to the proteolysis by proteases in human brain extract, purified calpain I cleaved MBP–CREB in a calcium- and dose-dependent manner (Figure 6D–F). MBP–CREB (93-kDa) was cleaved by lower concentration calpain I into 52-kDa and 41-kDa fragments mainly (Figure 6D). The 52-kDa could not be recognized by anti-middle region of CREB but by anti-N-terminal CREB (Figure 6E and F), whereas 41-kDa band was recognized by anti-middle region of CREB but not by anti-N-terminal CREB (Figure 6E and F). However, high concentration calpain I also cleaved MBP-CREB to 85-kDa big fragments, which was recognized by both anti-N-terminus and anti-middle region of CREB (Figure 6E and F). Thus, we speculated that 93-kDa MBP–CREB was cut by calpain I at N-terminal CREB and generated 41-kDa truncated CREB, which contained C-terminal CREB and 52-kDa fragment which consists of MBP and N-terminal CREB. So, we dissected the 41-kDa fragment and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis for five circles. The sequence of 41-kDa from N-terminus was AQPQI. Thus, we conclude that CREB was cleaved by calpain I at Gln28–Ala29 (Figure 7A). Truncated CREB has less ability to promote GLUT3 expressionCalpain I cleaves CREB at Gln28–Ala29 to generated 41-kDa truncated CREB (CREBΔN). Hence, we investigated the effect of the truncation on CREB-regulated GLUT3 expression. We constructed truncated pCI/CREBΔN (Figure 7A), transfected it into SH-SY5Y cells and performed ChIP with anti-HA as described previously. We observed that CREs in the promoter of GLUT3 precipitated by CREBΔN were much less than that by CREB (Figure 7B and C), suggesting weaker binding of CREBΔN than CREB. Transcriptional activity of CREB requires its phosphorylation at Ser133 (37). Thus, we expressed both CREB and CREBΔN in HEK-293FT cells and detected the phosphorylation level by western blots. Similar Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB was detected in CREB and CREBΔN (Figure7D). Moreover, forskolin treatment also increased binding of CREBΔN to CREs of GLUT3 promoter (Figure 7E), suggesting that truncation did not suppressed Ser133 phosphorylation. Figure 7.

(E) Forskolin treatment enhanced the binding of CREBΔN with the CRE of GLUT3 promoter. SH-SY5Y cells under differentiation condition were transfected with pCI/CREBΔN and treated with forskolin for 10 h, and then CREBΔN was immunoprecipitated by anti-HA. The three CREs were amplified by PCR with their specific primers. (F, G) CREBΔN had less ability to promote the luciferase expression. Luciferase activity was measured in the SH-SY5Y cells cotransfected with pGL3/GLUT3−2000 (F) or pGL3/GLUT3−126 (G) and pCI vector, pCI/CREB or pCI/CREBΔN and presented as mean ± SD (n = 3); *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01. To investigate the role of CREB truncation on its transcriptional activity to promote GLUT3 expression, we co-expressed CREBΔN or CREB in HEK-293T with pGL3/GLUT3−2000 (Figure 7F) and pGL3/GLUT3−126 (Figure 7G). The luciferase activity was assessed with dual luciferase assay. The luciferase activity in the HEK-293T cells transfected with CREBΔN was significantly lower than that in the cells transfected with CREB, which was independent of the various promoter regions of GLUT3 gene (Figure 7F and G). These results suggest that the N-terminal truncation of CREB may reduce its ability to promote GLUT3 expression. Level of GLUT3 is decreased in AD brain and correlates to CREB level positivelyTo determine whether decreased GLUT3 results from decreased CREB in AD brain, we analyzed GLUT3 level in frontal cortices from seven AD and seven control brains using western blots. GLUT3 level was decreased markedly in the frontal cortices of AD brains (Figure 8A and B), which is consistent with previous studies (29,30). Figure 8.

(A, B) Protein level of GLUT3 in AD was decreased. Western blots of frontal cortical homogenates from seven AD and seven control cases developed with anti-GLUT3. GAPDH blot was included as a loading control (A). Western blots were quantitated by densitometry and the relative level of GLUT3 is presented as mean ± SD; **P &lt; 0.01. (C) The level of GLUT3 correlated to CREB in human brain. The relative level of GLUT3 (y-axis) in the frontal cortical homogenates from seven AD and seven control cases is plotted against the level of CREB (x-axis). (D) Activation of calpain I correlated to the level of GLUT3 in human brain. The relative activation of calpain I [truncated/(full length + truncated)] (x-axis) is plotted against the level of GLUT3 (y-axis). Furthermore, we found that GLUT3 level was positively correlated with the full-length CREB (Figure 8C). Because we have found above that overactivation of calpain I in AD brain was responsible for the decreased CREB, we analyzed the relationship between GLUT3 level and calpain I activation by using Pearson correlation analysis. We found that activation of calpain I was negatively correlated with GLUT3 level in the human brain (Figure 8D). Previous SectionNext Section DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have demonstrated a decrease of GLUT3 protein level in AD brain (30), which might be a cause of the impaired brain glucose uptake/metabolism and associated neurodegeneration in this disease. In this study, we proved that PKA/CREB promotes the expression of GLUT3 by acting on the CRE-like elements, mainly CRE2 and CRE3, of the promoter region of human GLUT3. We further found that in AD brain, full-length CREB is decreased, truncation of CREB is increased and the level of full-length CREB negatively correlates with the activation of calpain I in human brain. In vitro, calpain I cleaves CREB at Gln28–Ala29 and generates a 41-kDa truncated CREB, which has less ability to promote GLUT3 expression. Moreover, the level of GLUT3 is correlated with the level of full-length CREB positively and with activation of calpain I negatively in human brain. It appears that in AD brain, the dysregulated calcium homeostasis probably leads to overactivation of calpain I, which, in turn, cleaves CREB, resulting in a weaker promotion in the expression of GLUT3 and other genes, consequently impairment of brain glucose uptake and metabolism. Thus, these findings provide a novel possible mechanism explaining the regulation of GLUT3 by CREB, the negative impact of the proteolysis of CREB by calpain I on the expression of GLUT3 and the involvement of this mechanism in impairment of brain glucose uptake and AD pathogenesis. Calpain is a family of calcium-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases that catalyzes limited proteolytic cleavage of a variety of cellular proteins in all eukaryotes (45,48). Calpain I, which is the major calpain isoform in the neuron, is fully activated by low micromolar concentrations of calcium (hence also called µ-calpain), whereas calpain II requires low millimolar levels of calcium for optimal activity (hence also called m-calpain). Calpain I is activated by removal of the N-terminal 14 amino acids of the 80-kDa subunit first to produce the 78-kDa intermediate product followed by removal of an additional 12 amino acids to produce the 76-kDa autolytic fragment (49). Many putative etiologic factors of AD, including excitotoxicity, β-amyloid neurotoxicity and free-radical injury, have in common the potential for disrupting intracellular calcium homeostasis (50–52). Though there is a lack of direct evidence of altered calcium homeostasis in AD brain, dysregulation of calcium is one of the major hypotheses that may explain the pathogenic mechanism of the disease (53,54). Calpain is thought to play a critical role in activation of neuronal cdk5 (55–57), MAPK pathway (58), PKA (59) and protein phosphatase 2B (46,60), as well as the truncation of tau, which in turn causes its abnormal hyperphosphorylation and leads to neuronal death (61,62). Elevated truncation and activation of calpain have been previously reported in early-stage AD (46,47). This study demonstrates that calpain I activation may also play a role in the impairment of glucose uptake via down-regulation of GLUT3 expression due to truncation of CREB in AD brain. CREB is the principal transcriptional factor exhibiting the most significant relevance to molecular networks of AD related genes (63). In the incipient of AD, studies on transcriptional network have shown that CREB is the most significant transcriptional regulator, suggesting that functional impairment of CREB in AD could begin at the early stage of the disease (63). The β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, alters hippocampal-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory and mediates synapse loss through the CREB-signaling pathway (64). The CREB-target genes play key roles in neuronal development, synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection in the central nervous system. Among those, BDNF is a well-studied CREB-target gene and has important roles during development and adult life (65,66) in neuronal growth, survival, differentiation and synaptic function (67,68). Numerous reports have indicated that the relative levels of BDNF mRNA and proteins are decreased in severe AD when compared with aged-matched controls (69–74). CREB binds onto CRE of promoters as a dimer and activates gene expression. CRE typically appears as either palindrome (TGACGTCA) or half-site (CGTCA) sequences (75,76). Half-site is less active than the full-CRE palindrome for CREB binding and AMP responsiveness (37,77,78). The human GLUT3 gene does not have the typical CRE element but has three potential CRE-like sequences. These three CRE-like elements have much weaker CREB-binding activity than the typical ‘TGACGTCA’ CRE consensus sequence. These three CRE-like elements are located from −1631 to −1610 bp for CRE1, from −116 to −95 bp for CRE2 and from +101 to +121 bp for CRE3. In this study, deletion of CRE1 did not affect GLUT3 promoter-driven luciferase expression, suggesting that CRE1 does not act as a significant enhancer in the expression of GLUT3, even though it could bind to CREB. Deletion of the region containing either CRE2 or CRE3 significantly reduced the expression of luciferase, suggesting that CRE2 and CRE3 serve as enhancers of GLUT3. Mutations of CRE2 or CRE3 significantly decreased the promotion of GLUT3 expression, further supporting their requirement for promotion of GLUT3 expression. CREB contains an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) and a C-terminal basic Leu zipper DNA-binding and dimerization domain. In the TAD, a central kinase-inducible domain (KID), containing a PKA phosphorylation site, Ser133, is flanked by hydrophobic glutamine-rich domains, Q1 and Q2. The Q domains enhance transcription by interacting with other associated factors (79). In this study, we found that CREB was proteolysed in vitro by calpain I at Gln28–Ala29 and generated truncated CREB, which lacks a part of Q1. Truncated CREB bound less to CREs in the promoter of GLUT3 and had less activity to promote GLUT3 expression but did not affect its Ser133 phosphorylation. These results further verify that Q1 domain enhances transcription (79) and that removal of a part of N-terminal Q1 by calpain I may reduce its transcription activity. The transcription activity of CREB is mainly regulated by its phosphorylation at Ser133 by PKA (80). We have shown in this study that CREB phosphorylation is also required for promoting GLUT3 expression, because the Ser133 to Ala mutation eliminated CREB’s ability to promote GLUT3-droved luciferase expression. In AD brain, PKA activity is decreased due to overactivation of calpain I (59). Therefore, calpain I over-activation may result in decreased GLUT3 expression by two pathways, PKA down-regulation and CREB truncation, synergistically. Most glucose in the brain is metabolized to produce ATP to maintain neuronal activity. Approximately 2–5% of total glucose feeds into the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway to produce glucosamine-6-phosphate, and, ultimately, UDP-Nacetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) (42). UDP-GlcNAc is the donor substrate for O-linked-β-Nacetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT), which catalyzes protein O-GlcNAcylation, a process transferring GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to Ser/Thr residues of proteins. O-GlcNAcylation is a recently recognized post-translational modification of numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. The activity of OGT is sensitive to relatively small changes in UDP-GlcNAc availability over a wide range of concentrations (43). Therefore, decreased GLUT3 may cause impairment of glucose up-take, leading to down-regulation of O-GlcNAcylation of proteins. Microtubule-associated protein tau is modified by O-GlcNAcylation. In AD brain, tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and accumulated in the form of NFTs (81,82). Many studies have demonstrated that abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau is critical to neurodegeneration and promotes its aggregation into tangles (83–89). We recently found that tau phosphorylation is inversely regulated by O-GlcNAcylation and that decreased O-GlcNAcylation induces hyperphosphorylation of tau (44). In AD brain, protein O-GlcNAcylation is markedly decreased and correlated negatively with phosphorylation at most phosphorylation sites of tau protein (90). Therefore, decreased GLUT3 may down-regulate O-GlcNAcylation via reduction of neuronal glucose uptake, leading to abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau and neurofibrillary degeneration in AD. In summary, overactivation of calpain I due to overload of calcium in AD brain proteolyses CREB to truncated CREB, which has less ability to promote GLUT3 expression and might cause a reduction of glucose uptake and metabolism in the brain and consequently neurodegeneration and dementia.

Fighting Alzheimer’s disease? Get the immune system on board. James Fuller James Fuller discusses his research into developing antibodies against Alzheimer’s disease in the third and final highly commended article for the Max Perutz Science Writing Award 2012. Imagine living with the knowledge that over the next decade your brain will be slowly destroyed by your own body. As neurons are snuffed out like candles, what will you lose next? Will it be precious memories? The ability to perform an everyday task? Perhaps a facet of your personality? Your family and friends will have to watch helpless as the person they love is slowly eroded away. Imagine now finding out that with all of our medical expertise there is nothing we can do. Not one treatment that can slow the course of this deterioration. This is a reality for someone diagnosed with dementia. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia with an estimated 20 million sufferers worldwide, incurring a L400 billion cost to healthcare services. These figures are already frightening, but our population is getting older and the number of people with dementia will double in 30 years. The only way to prevent this is to develop new drugs to combat this devastating condition. Current therapies work by increasing certain chemicals in the brain; allowing neurons to function but not stopping them from dying. Despite a lot of research and trials of potential drugs not one therapy has been found that can slow the rate at which neurons die. So, what is holding us back from developing these new therapies? There are many problems but perhaps the biggest is that we do not fully understand how this disease works, and how to model the disease in the lab. This may be the reason why so many drugs have failed in clinical trials — clearly what we need are new approaches. By looking at the blood or brains of patients we can get an idea of what goes wrong in Alzheimer’s disease and therefore design potential new treatments. From these studies we now know that a protein called Aß for an unknown reason builds up in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients, forming large clumps called plaques. One idea suggests that the buildup of these plaques causes the destruction of neurons, and therefore removal of these plaques could protect the neurons from dying. As a result of this observation, therapies are being developed to break up these deposits or reduce the amount of Aß produced. One of the most effective and revolutionary ideas has been to “vaccinate” Alzheimer’s patients against these plaques. This is a very similar process to what happens when you are vaccinated against a disease like tuberculosis (TB). The TB vaccine teaches your immune system to recognise and remember a dead version of the bacteria which causes the disease. This means that when you encounter the real bacteria, immune cells can fight off the infection. During this process, antibodies are being produced that bind to the bacteria; the immune system is then activated to engulf and destroy the antibody-coated bacteria preventing you from getting ill. At this point you may be wondering; what does this have to do with Alzheimer’s disease? Scientists can produce antibodies in the lab that bind to almost anything: a virus, a cancer cell or even the plaques we find in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. When an Alzheimer’s patient is treated with an antibody that binds to plaques, these deposits become coated in the antibody. The subsequent immune response clears the patient’s brain of these potentially dangerous plaques. Fantastic, so we can now use these antibodies to help patients? Well not quite… while the antibody efficiently clears the plaques from the brain, the success has been tempered by side effects. To remove the antibody-coated plaques it is necessary to activate cells from the immune system and this can cause inflammation in the brain. While this inflammation is actually helpful in removing bacteria such as TB, inflammation in the brain can have severe consequences. Inflammation in Alzheimer’s patients occurs around blood vessels in the brain causing damage and bleeding, potentially inducing further deterioration and memory loss. For my PhD project I am developing new antibodies to prevent these nasty side effects. By making tiny adjustments to the structure of antibodies we can control how the immune system responds to the therapy. We are hoping that these new antibodies remove the plaques without inducing further damage to the brain. Advances in healthcare have greatly increased the length of time we live, however the quality of life we experience in our older years has not increased at the same rate. Dementia is one of science’s biggest challenges and the problem will only get worse if new therapies are not found soon. Harnessing the power of the immune system using antibodies may be one of these therapies, and this has already been an effective strategy in the treatment of bacterial infections, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. If we could make this form of therapy safe for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, it would be a good step forward to reduce the suffering of millions of patients worldwide.

Alanna Shaikh: How I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's. I'd like to talk about my dad. My dad has Alzheimer's disease. He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago, and he was officially diagnosed in 2005. Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating, he needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is or when it is, and it's been really, really hard. My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life, and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear. My dad's not alone. There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia, and by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million. That's a lot of people. Dementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia, the big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us. And because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things: We go into denial: "It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me." Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia, and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us. I'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. Prevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's. I'm eating right, I'm exercising every day, I'm keeping my mind active, that's what the research says you should do. But the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100 percent protect you. If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you. That's what happened with my dad. My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds. (Laughter) He got dementia anyway. If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you. Especially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families. So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father, and researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation: I'm changing what I do for fun, I'm working to build my physical strength, and -- this is the hard one -- I'm trying to become a better person. Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself. You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends, because you don't know who they are. It's confusing to watch television, and often very frightening. And reading is just about impossible. When you care for someone with dementia, and you get training, they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended. With my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms. He was a college professor at a state school; he knows what paperwork looks like. He'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes, he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers. But it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me? I'm my father's daughter. I read, I write, I think about global health a lot. Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins? Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color? So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on. I've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it. I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box. (Laughter) And I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob. But, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it. Because the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do, the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore. They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier, easier for their caregivers to look after, and it may even slow the progress of the disease. That all seems like win to me. I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can. A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms, as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance, you get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile. They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move. So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance. I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it, I'll still be able to be mobile. I'm doing weight-bearing exercise, so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around. Finally, the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person. My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's, and he's kind and loving now. I've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skills, but I've also seen this: He loves me, he loves my sons, he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers. And that love makes us want to be around him, even now. even when it's so hard. When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world, his naked heart still shines. I was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving. And what I need now is to learn to be like that. I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive. I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease. What I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me. But if it comes for me, I'm going to be ready. Thank you. (Applause)

Up-regulation of Seladin-1 reduces the accumulation of β-amyloid and neuronal death. Thyroid hormone (TH) exerts an important effect on the development and maintenance of central nervous systems. In the current study, we demonstrated that Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the forebrain was increased in thyrotoxic mice compared with that of euthyroid mice. However, unexpectedly, no significant decrease in the gene and protein expression was observed in hypothyroid mice. Interestingly, an agonist of liver X receptor (LXR), TO901317 (TO) administration in vivo increased Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the mouse forebrain only in a hypothyroid state and in the presence of mutant TR-β, suggesting that LXR-α would compensate for TR-β function to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroidism and resistance to TH. TH activated the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (−1936/+21 bp) and site 2 including canonical TH response element (TRE) half-site in the region between −159 and −154 bp is responsible for the positive regulation. RXR-α/TR-β heterodimerization was identified on site 2 by gel-shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed the recruitment of TR-β to site 2 and the recruitment was increased upon TH administration. On the other hand, LXR-α utilizes a distinct region from site 2 (−120 to −102 bp) to activate the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter. Taking these findings together, we concluded that TH up-regulates Seladin-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level and LXR-α maintains the gene expression.Citation: Ishida E, Hashimoto K, Okada S, Satoh T, Yamada M, et al.

However, the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been revealed.Thyroid hormone (TH) is well known to play an important role in the development and maintenance of the central nervous system in mammals [3], [4]. TH exerts its biological function through thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). TRs are nuclear hormone receptors, to which triiodothyronine (T3) binds at a high-affinity order as a native ligand. TRs possess at least two isoforms, TR-α and -β (Nr1a1 and Nr1a2), and several isoforms exist as two or three subtypes, respectively (α1, α2, β1, β2, and β3) [5]. It is of note that only TR-α1, β1 and β2 have both a ligand binding and a DNA binding domain [6]. TR-α1 is widely expressed in tissues including heart, muscle, intestine, bone, and brain and plays a key role in regulating postnatal development and cardiac metabolism, whereas TR-β1 is also widely expressed in brain, cochlea, pituitary, kidney, lung, heart and at its highest level in the liver regulating multiple steps in hepatic metabolism as well as thyroid hormone levels [6]. TR-β2 expression is mainly in the pituitary, the hypothalamic TRH neurons, the developing inner ear and retina [7]. Thus, both TR-α and TR-β play an important role for the development and the maintenance of the central nervous system even though their expression patterns are spatiotemporally distinct [8]–[10]. Hypothyroidism sometimes leads to the development of dementia-like symptoms, especially in elderly patients [11], [12]. The TH receptor (TR) β-Δ337T knock-in (TRKI) mouse demonstrates severe cerebellar ataxia and cognitive dysfunction [13]. As such, although case reports and basic studies support the idea that TH is closely related to AD pathogenesis and could be beneficial to cure AD [14]–[16], large-scale clinical studies examining the relationship between thyroid function and AD have led to controversial conclusions [17]–[20].Among many genes related to AD, we focused on selective AD indicator 1, Seladin-1 gene. Seladin-1 gene expression is down-regulated in the vulnerable region in the brain of AD patients [21]. Up-regulation of Seladin-1 in the neuron leads to the reduction of β-amyloid accumulation and apoptosis [21]–[23]. Seladin-1 gene codes 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), which catalyzes the final step of cholesterol synthesis [24]. Cholesterol inside the neuron inhibits co-localization of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE), protecting β-amyloid accumulation [22], [25]. Thus, cholesterol in the neuron is responsible for maintenance of neural function [25]. Seladin-1 protects the neuron by increasing the intracellular cholesterol synthesis [21], [22], [26]. In a previous report, TH administration to some neuronal precursor cell lines induced Seladin-1 gene expression [27]. However, the molecular mechanism by which TH up-regulates Seladin-1 mRNA levels is yet to be elucidated.Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear oxysterol receptors and play pivotal roles in cholesterol metabolism [28], [29]. LXRs comprise two isoforms, LXR-α and -β. Both isoforms are expressed in the brain, although the latter is expressed at significantly higher levels [30]. An artificial agonist of LXR, TO901317 (TO), reduces β-amyloid accumulation and AD-specific pathological changes in the brain of an AD model mouse [31]–[33]. Since LXR response element (LXRE) is identified in the second intron in human Seladin-1 gene promoter, another group has suggested that Seladin-1 gene promoter may be a target of LXR [34]. However, the molecular mechanism by which LXRs regulate Seladin-1 gene expression has been yet to be elucidated.TRs and LXRs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Although LXRs and TRs belong to two distinct receptor subgroups with respect to ligand-binding affinity [35], the two receptor systems show similarity with respect to molecular mechanism, target genes, and physiological roles [36]. Since both TRs and LXRs play an important role in metabolic regulation, form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and bind to direct repeat-4 (DR-4) with identical geometry and polarity [28], [36]–[38], crosstalk between the two receptors has been reported, especially on lipid metabolism-related genes [37]–[43].In the current study, we demonstrate that TH increased Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the mouse forebrain. However, no significant difference between euthyroid and hypothyroid mice was observed. Interestingly, TO administration in vivo increased Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the mouse forebrain only in a hypothyroid state and in the presence of mutant TR-β. We also show that TH activates mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter and identify a novel positive thyroid hormone response element named site 2 including canonical thyroid hormone response element (TRE) half-site in the mouse promoter. Taking these findings together, we concluded that TH up-regulates Seladin-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level and that LXR-α would compensate for TR-β function to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroidism and resistance to TH (RTH). Thus, our data strongly suggests that TR and LXR crosstalk in Seladin-1 gene regulation.Materials and MethodsAnimals8 to 12-week-old male C57/BL6 (B6) and TRKI mice (generously provided by Prof. Fredric E. Wondisford, Johns Hopkins medical institute, Baltimore) were employed for the study. All aspects of animal care were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine (Maebashi, Gunma, Japan, Protocol number #10-059). Animals were maintained on a 12 h light/12 h dark schedule (lights on at 06:00 h) and fed laboratory chow as indicated and given water ad libitum. Hypothyroidism was induced in the B6 mice by the inclusion of 0.1% methimazole (MMI) in the drinking water and 1% (w/w) propylthiouracil (PTU) in the chow for 21 days [37], [41]. To induce a thyrotoxic state, the B6 mice were injected daily with 10 µg per 20 g body weight of T3 for 7 days [37]. For TO treatment, 1 mg per 20 g body weight of TO901317 (#71810 Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI) was intraperitoneally administered daily for 7 days [31], [33] or vehicle (DMSO) was administered for Sham group. The number of mice receiving each treatment is indicated in the figures. Serum-free T3 and T4 levels were measured by SRL (Tokyo, Japan). We anatomically excised cerebellum, diencephalon, pituitary, hypothalamus, and medulla oblongata from the whole brain of mouse and obtained the rest as forebrain for the analysis as we reported previously [13].PlasmidsThe mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (−1936/+21 bp) plasmid, which contained the region from −1936 to +21 bp of the mouse Seladin-1 gene, was generated by genomic PCR using 5′-GTGTGGTACCTGGTGGCAGGAGAGAGCCCC-3′ as a sense primer and 5′-GTGTAGATCTGTAAGTCGGGCCCGCCGCC-3′ as an anti-sense primer. An Asp718 or BglII restriction enzyme site was introduced into each primer sequence so that the PCR product could be subcloned between these sites in the pGL4-Luc vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The deletion mutants and a site 1 or site 2 point mutants were generated with PCR site-directed mutagenesis [37], [43], [44]. All human TR-β1 and its mutants, human TR-α1, RXR-α, murine LXR-α, and LXR-β cDNAs were placed into an SV40 expression construct, pSG5 [44]. All PCR-generated constructs were verified by sequencing the DNA.Transfections and Luciferase AssayFor the luciferase assay, we employed CV-1 cells. 10 µg of the reporter plasmid and 0.25 µg of human TR-β1 or TR-α1 or mouse LXR-α1 or LXR-β in pSG5 was transfected per plate of a 6-well format into CV-1 cells using the calcium-phosphate method. Sixteen hours after transfection, cultures were treated with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% resin charcoal double-stripped fetal bovine serum for 8 hours in the absence or presence of 10−8 M T3 or 10−6 M TO. All transfections were equalized for the same total amount of expression vector using an empty vector as needed. We performed β-gal assays to confirm the transfection efficiency of the luciferase assay for each experiment at least once and found no significant difference in transfection efficiency among the plates. Data are presented as fold basal activation over vector (pSG5) in the absence of ligand stimulation ± SEM or as otherwise indicated. Luciferase activity is expressed as arbitrary light units per µg of cellular protein. All transfection experiments were repeated at least twice with triplicate determinations.Western BlottingFor analysis of the protein expression of Seladin-1 (DHCR24), 30 µg of whole cell extract from mouse forebrain was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using a rabbit anti-DHCR24 polyclonal antibody (#ab40490, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) to detect Sealdin-1 protein levels and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (#ab8245, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) as a control. The Seladin-1 detects a specific band at 55 kDa in tissues and cells. The bands were quantitatively measured using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Corp., San Jose, CA) and ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997–2011). All Western blotting experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Seladin-1 protein levels are normalized by GAPDH. Data are presented as fold basal euthyroid (E) levels ± SEM or as otherwise indicated.RNA Preparation and Real-time Quantitative PCRTotal RNA was extracted from mouse forebrain using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Real-time quantitative PCR assays were performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 sequence detector with the standard 40 cycles. Briefly, 1 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using the TaqmanTM Reverse Transcription Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Mouse Seladin-1 mRNA expression was analyzed using TaqmanTM probes (Mm00519071_m1, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). We set up a standard curve for each real-time PCR and confirmed that all PCR products were on the standard curve as we previously described [43]. The PCR results were normalized to mouse cyclophilin A expression using a TaqmanTM probe (Mm02342430_gl, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The number of samples is indicated in the figure legends.Gel-shift AssaysElectrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs, gel-shift assays) were performed as described previously [45]. Mouse LXR-α, human TR-β1, and human RXR-α recombinant proteins were synthesized from constructs in the pSG5 expression vector, using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/ Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI). Binding reactions contained 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mM KCl, 12% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 µg of poly (dI-dC)(dI-dC), and 6 µl of each of the synthesized nuclear receptors or unprogrammed reticulocyte lysates. Double-stranded oligonucleotides (DR-4 for rat cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1): 5′- TGTTTGCTTTGGTCACTCAAGTTCAA-3′, Site 1 probe ; 5′- CTCCCACCCTGGGGAGGTTACCCAATGCACAACT-3′, Site 2 probe ; 5′- AGCGCCCCCAGCCCAGGTCAGCCCCTCCTCGCAC-3′) were labeled with [α-32P] deoxy-CTP by a fill-in reaction using a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min. For competition experiments, a 20- or 40-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotides was included. For supershift experiments, 3 µl of rabbit anti-TR-β1 polyclonal antibody (06-539, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) or mouse anti-LXR-α monoclonal antibody (PP-PPZ0412-00, Perseus proteomics, Tokyo, Japan) was added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5X TBE (45 mM Tris-base, 1 mM EDTA). All gel-shift assays were repeated at least three times with similar results and a representative result is shown.Small Interfering (si) RNA against LXRsWe employed Dharmacon’s siRNA against human LXR-α (L-003413-00-0005, ON-TARGET plus SMART pool, human NR1H3) and LXR-β (L-003412-00-0005, ON-TARGET plus SMART pool, human NR1H2) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). The target sequences of siRNA for human LXR-α are as follows: 5′-GAGUUUGCCUUGCUCAUUG-3′; 5′-CGACUGAUGUUCCCACGGA-3′; 5′-GAACAACUGGGCAUGAUCG-3′; 5′-CCUCAAGGAUUUCAGUUAU-3′, and the target sequences for LXR-β were as follows: 5′-AACAGCGGCUCAAGAACUA-3′; 5′-CUAAGCAAGUGCCUGGUUU-3′; 5′-GAAGAAGAUUCGGAAACAG-3′; 5′-CAACCACGAGACAGAGUGU-3′. SiRNA for the negative control (ON-TARGET plus Non-targeting pool, D-001810-10-20, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA) was employed. SiRNAs were transfected into HTB185 cells, derived from human medulloblastoma using the lipofection method (Lipofectamine RNAiMAX, Invitrogen). Briefly, in the 6-well format, 50 pmol of siRNAs against each LXR (α or β) or 100 pmol of non-targeting siRNA per well were transfected into the HTB185 cells. Sixteen hours after transfection, cultures were treated with DMEM containing 10% resin charcoal double-stripped fetal bovine serum for 8 hours in the absence or presence of 10−6 M TO. After incubation, total RNA was extracted from the cells and real-time quantitative PCR assays were performed as described above. Human Seladin-1, LXR-α and LXR-β mRNA expression levels were analyzed using TaqmanTM probes (Hs00207388_m1, Hs00172885_m1 and Hs00173195_m1, respectively. Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) AssayChIP assays were performed using a kit (ChIP-ITTM Express) from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol with some modifications. Briefly, in prior to ChIP assays, the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (−1113/+21 bp) in pGL4 was transfected into the HTB185 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The transfected HTB185 cells were incubated in medium containing 10% resin-charcoal double-stripped fetal bovine serum with or without 10−8 M T3. After incubation, formaldehyde (37%) was directly added to the culture at a final concentration of 1% and the cells were incubated for 15 min at 37°C to crosslink protein to DNA. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 600 µl of lysis buffer supplemented with 3 µl of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC) and 0.5 mM PMSF and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. The resuspended cells were passed through a 27G syringe 10 times to aid nucleus release. The nucleus pellet was resuspended in 210 µl of Shearing Buffer (supplemented with 1.05 µl of PIC) and the samples were placed on ice. The nucleus lysate was sonicated 4 times with 10-sec pulses using a sonicator set at 50% of maximum power to reduce DNA length to between 200 and 1000 bp. Sheared chromatin solution (50 µl) was used for each ChIP assay with 2 µg of a mouse anti-TR-β monoclonal antibody (PP-H3825A-00, Perseus proteomics, Tokyo, Japan), mouse anti-LXR-α monoclonal antibody (PP-K8607-00, Perseus proteomics, Tokyo, Japan) and rabbit anti-RXR-α polyclonal antibody (sc-774, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). As a negative control, normal rabbit IgG (#2729, Cell Signaling Technology, Denver, CO) was used. For Ct value-based evaluation of ChIP results, quantitative PCR was performed with power SYBR Green (#4367659, Applied Biosystems) in Applied Biosystems 7500 sequence detector by using 1 µl of immunoprecipitate or input according to the manufacturer’s specified parameters. The primers used for the region between −226 bp and +21 bp for quantitative PCR were as follows: forward 5′-CTCCAGAGCGAGAGCCCTAA-3′ and reverse 5′-GTAAGTCGGGCCCGCCGCCT-3′. The predicted PCR product was 247 bp long. The values were corrected using the input values and presented as %input ± SEM. All ChIP assays were repeated at least twice with triplicate determinations.Statistical AnalysesStatistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and parametric Welch’s t-test or nonparametric Mann-Whitney test [46], [47] where appropriate to assess statistical differences between means with Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Values are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).ResultsT3 Up-regulates Seladin-1 Gene Expression in the Mouse ForebrainTo examine whether TH regulates mouse Seladin-1 gene expression, we performed real-time RT-PCR using mouse forebrain steady-state total RNA. For this purpose, we first rendered the B6 mice in a hypothyroid state (H) with an MMI/PTU diet, or made them thyrotoxic (T) with T3 administration intraperitoneally (Figure 1A, 1B). TH levels (free T4 and free T3) are shown in Table 1. As shown in Figure 1A, when T3 was administered to 8- to 12-week-old B6 mice intraperitoneally, Seladin-1 gene expression levels in the forebrain were increased about 2.5-fold. Unexpectedly, mice in a hypothyroid state did not show significant down-regulation of Seladin-1 gene compared to the control. We obtained a similar result for protein expression levels (Figure 1B).thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 1.

Free T4 and free T3 levels in each thyroid state.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054901.t001 TO Up-regulates Seladin-1 Gene Expression in the Mouse Forebrain Under Hypothyroid Status and in the Forebrain of TRKI MiceBased on the data that hypothyroid treatment did not reduce Seladin-1 gene expression, from a perspective of TR-LXR crosstalk as previously reported [5], [37], [48], we speculated that LXR would compensate to maintain the gene expression under hypothyroid status. Unexpectedly, as shown in Figure 2A, TO did not change Seladin-1 gene expression levels in the forebrain of B6 mice in the basal status. However, in a hypothyroid state, TO increased Seladin-1 gene expression levels in the forebrain (by 2.1 fold, Figure 2C). We obtained a similar result for protein expression levels (Figure 2B, 2D). As previously reported [41], free T4 levels of TRKI mice (homozygous mice), which demonstrates severe thyroid dysfunction were extremely high (over 7.77 ng/dl) because of RTH (data not shown). However, Seladin-1 mRNA and protein levels in the forebrain of TRKI mice were comparable to those of wild-type (WT) mice (Figure 3A, 3B). On the other hand, as shown in Figure 3C, administration of TO significantly increased Seladin-1 gene expression in the forebrain of TRKI mice compared with that of Sham group about 1.2-fold. We obtained a similar result for protein expression levels (Figure 3D). These lines of evidence supported our hypothesis; LXRs compensate to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroidism and/or in TR-β dysfunction.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 2.

We employed this reporter construct and performed luciferase assays with CV-1 cells, which are known to be deficient for endogenous TRs [45]. When we co-transfected the gene promoter (−1936/+21 bp) with TR-β1 into CV-1 cells, T3 significantly activated the promoter activity, however the up-regulation was not observed with co-transfection of TR-α1 (Figure 4A). These data indicated that TH activates mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter via TR-β. Next, we prepared a series of deletion constructs of the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (Figure 4B), which were subjected to transfection into CV-1 cells with these reporters together with TR-β1. As shown in Figure 4C, the −136/+21 construct was not activated by T3. We identified two TRE half-sites, one is located from −304 to −299 bp and the other one is located from −159 to −154 bp in the mouse Seladin-1 promoter and hypothesized that these TRE half site regions could be a novel positive TRE. We referred to the upstream and downstream region as site 1 and 2, respectively. We introduced mutation into the TRE half-site in site 1 and 2 in the context of the −1936/+21 reporter (Figure 4D, upper panel). As shown in Figure 4E, lower panel, the positive regulation by T3 deteriorated in the mutt 2 reporter, indicating that the TRE half-site in site 2 is functionally important.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 4.

NS: not significant.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054901.g004 TR-β1 DNA Binding is Essential for Positive Regulation of Mouse Seladin-1 Gene PromoterWe co-transfected several types of mutant TR-β1 and the −1936/+21 reporter into CV-1 cells. As shown in Figure 4F, GS125, a DNA binding mutant [49], Δ337T, a ligand binding mutant [50], [51], and R427Q [51], [52], a heterodimerization mutant with RXR-α, did not activate the promoter, whereas E457A, a co-activator binding mutant [53], positively regulated mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter activity as wild-type TR-β1. These data suggest that ligand binding, TR-β1 DNA binding, and heterodimerization with RXR-α are required for the positive regulation.RXR-α/TR-β1 Heterodimer Binds to Site 2Since we found that site 2 is functionally important for the positive regulation of the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter based on the reporter assay data (Figure 4E), we hypothesized that TR-β1 could bind to site 2 in the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter. To investigate this, we employed oligonucleotides for site 1, encompassing −318 to −285 bp and for site 2, from −173 to −140 bp in the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter, including the TRE consensus half-site motif. We performed electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) with the radiolabeled site 1 and 2 probes (Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 5B, it was revealed that RXR-α/TR-β1 heterodimer bound to site 2 but not to site 1. Anti-TR-β antibody shifted the heterodimer band, indicating that the binding was TR-β-specific. In addition, either RXR-α/TR-α1 heterodimer or TR-α1 homodyne did not bind to site 2 (data not shown).thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 5.

As shown in Figure 6A, TO significantly increased human Seladin-1 gene expression about 1.5 fold (left graph). In addition, induction of siRNA against LXR-α/β into HTB185 cells revealed that TO did not increase the gene expression in LXRs knockdown-HTB185 cells (Figure 6A, right graph). These data indicate that TO increases Seladin-1 gene expression in HTB185 cells through intrinsic LXRs. We confirmed LXR-α and -β gene expression levels in the HTB 185 cells, which siRNA against LXR-α/β was induced (Figure 6B). It revealed that both LXR isoform gene expression levels were significantly reduced in the LXRs knockdown cells. In addition, TO induced the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (−1936/+21 bp) in CV-1 cells in the presence of LXR-α or LXR-β indicating that both isoforms potentiate to activate the gene promoter upon TO administration (Figure 6C). However, as shown in Figure 6B, since the gene expression of LXR-α was robust compared to that of LXR-β, we concluded that LXR-α is the dominant isoform in HTB185 cells. Thus, we employed LXR-α for further analysis of the up-regulation of mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter by TO.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 6.

An analysis of deletion constructs of the gene promoter revealed that the −102/+21 construct was not activated by TO indicating that the region from −120 to −102 bp but not site 2 is responsible for the positive regulation (Figure 7A). Moreover, EMSA demonstrated that LXR-α or RXR-α/LXR-α heterodimer did not bind to site 2 (Figure 7B). We performed EMSA employing several probes with different sequence including the region from −120 to −102 bp; however, LXR-α or RXR-α/LXR-α heterodimer did not bind to any probes (data not shown).thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 7.

We introduced the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (−1113 to +21 bp) in HTB185 cells by transient transfection. As shown in Figure 8B, in HTB185 cells, the recruitment of intrinsic TR-β to the −226 to +21 bp region significantly increased upon T3 administration. Since the set of PCR primer covers the region from −120 to −102 bp, with which LXR-α should interact, LXR-α recruitment to the region was observed in the absence of TH, but TH significantly reduced the recruitment.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 8.

NS: not significant.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054901.g008 DiscussionIn the current study, we demonstrated that mouse Seladin-1 mRNA and protein levels in forebrain were up-regulated by TH administration in vivo. We have obtained some controversial results from the in vivo study. While Seladin-1 gene expression is induced in a thyrotoxic state, under hypothyroid treatment, the gene and protein expression levels were not significantly reduced compared to those in a euthyroid state (Figure 1). Moreover, no significant differences in the gene expression between wild-type and TRKI mice, which was expected to recapitulate hypothyroid state in the forebrain, were found (Figure 3A and 3B). This in vivo data indicated a compensation to maintain the gene expression should exist. First, we tried to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which TH up-regulates the gene expression and we demonstrated that the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter was activated by T3 in CV-1 cells. Benvenuti et al. reported that TH up-regulates the Seladin-1 gene expression in in vitro model of human neuronal precursor cell lines [27]. They conformed that TR-α1, TR-β1 and TR-β2 genes were expressed in these neuronal precursor cell lines, however it was unclear whether the up-regulation of the Seladin-1 gene expression by T3 was isoform specific. It is well known that both TR-α and TR-β are important for the development and maintenance of central nervous system in mammals and other species [7]–[10], [54]. Thus, we examined the activation of the Seladin-1 gene promoter by T3 could be TR isoform specific and found that TR-β but not TR-α is responsible for the positive regulation (Figure 4A). The gene promoter investigated in the current study contains two consensus TRE-half sites; site 1 and 2. Through the analysis of deletion mutant promoters and EMSAs, we have identified site 2 as a novel positive TRE. Estrogen receptor (ER) is another nuclear receptor closely related to Seladin-1 gene expression. Estrogens are well known to exert neurotropic and neuroprotective effects in vitro [55], [56] and increase Seladin-1 gene expression in fetal neuroepithelial cells [57]. Similar to site 2 for TR, half-palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) in Seladin-1 gene promoter is functionally responsible for the promoter activation by ER [58].The ChIP assays using HTB185 cells revealed that TR-β is recruited to site 2 flanking region and that the recruitment is augmented upon T3 administration. Generally, TR-β as a type 2 nuclear receptor should constitutively bind to DNA in the gene promoter in the presence or absence of T3; however, recently, Liu et al. reported that TR-β was recruited to the TRE in a T3-dose-dependent manner in a time-course study [59]. Our data regarding TR-β recruitment is congruent with this report by Liu et al. The study employing several types of TR-β mutant revealed that the positive regulation of the promoter by TR-β required ligand binding, DNA binding, and heterodimerization with RXR-α, and that co-activator binding does not seem to be necessarily required for the regulation (Figure 4F).Crosstalk between TR-β and LXR-α has been reported, especially on lipid metabolism-related genes. Recently, several types of crosstalk between TRs and LXRs have been identified and crosstalk has also been observed in other physiological systems such as central nervous system other than lipid metabolism [5], [41], [48]. Therefore, we hypothesized that LXR-α could compensate to maintain mouse Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroid status and in the TRKI mice. Supporting our hypothesis, TO, an artificial agonist of LXRs, induced the gene expression in a hypothyroid state (Figure 2C, 2D) and in TRKI mice (Figure 3C, 3D), but not in euthyroid state (Figure 2A, 2B). Since TO clearly increased Seladin-1 gene expression in HTB185 cells through intrinsic LXRs and induced the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter activity in CV-1 cells, Seladin-1 is considered as an LXR target gene. Wang et al. reported that Seladin-1 gene expression in the brain of LXR-β knockout mice was not decreased compared to that of wild-type mice [34]. We speculate that it is due to that TR-β dominantly regulates Seladin-1 gene expression in mice. Another speculation is that LXR-β could not be required for the regulation of mouse Seladin-1 gene in forebrain.We demonstrated that LXR-α is a dominant isoform in HTB185 cells, in which Seladin-1 gene expression was positively regulated by TO (Figure 6), therefore we employed LXR-α to elucidate a molecular mechanism for the positive regulation of the gene. Based on the data obtained by the analysis of deletion constructs of the gene promoter, LXR-α activated the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter and the responsible region should be located from −120 to −102 bp. The exact sequence of the region is GAGCATCCCGGTTCCCGC, which does not match either canonical TRE or LXRE. We performed EMSAs employing various probes with different sequence in the region; however, LXR-α or RXR-α/LXR-α heterodimer did not bind to any probes. To examine LXR-α recruitment in vivo, we tried to perform in vivo ChIP assays using mouse forebrain as we previously reported with liver [37], [41], [43], however, it did not work probably due to excessed lipid contents in the tissue. Therefore, alternatively we employed HTB185 cells to recapitulate physiological environment utilizing intrinsic nuclear receptors. Since HTB185 cells are derived from human medulloblastoma, we had to introduce the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter as described above. The ChIP assays demonstrated that LXR-α was clearly recruited to the region from −226 to +21 bp. Even though RXR-α was also recruited to the region, it remains unclear whether LXR-α recruitment requires RXR-α in the current study. Collectively, we speculated that LXR-α is recruited to the region without DNA binding. Since site 2 is located upstream of the region from −120 to −102 bp, TR-β and LXR-α do not share the same response element in the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter. The ChIP assays also demonstrated that LXR-α recruitment was deteriorated upon TH administration indicating that in thyrotoxic state, LXR-α could not induce the gene promoter. On the basis of these several lines of evidence, we speculate that in a thyrotoxic state, TR-β binds to site 2 and regulates Seladin-1 gene expression; on the other hand, LXR-α may functionally compensate for TR-β being recruited to the region from −120 to −102 bp under hypothyroid state or in the presence of mutant TR-β to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression (Figure 9). In hypothyroid status, co-repressors such as NCoR and SMRT [60], [61] are hard to dissociate from TR-β because of lack of T3. Co-repressors are tethered to TR-β Δ337T mutant, which TRKI mice harbor, because of total deficiency of ligand binding of the mutant receptor. Indeed, NCoR binds to both TR-β and LXR-α and is a key regulator of TR and LXR target genes [62]. Therefore, considering the data obtained from analysis of TRKI mice and luciferase assay using TR-β Δ337T mutant, we hypothesize that in hypothyroid state and in RTH, co-repressors should be tethered to TR-β in a squelching fashion and LXR-α are relatively free from co-repressors, which enables to activate the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter upon administration of the LXR specific ligand.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 9. Schematic diagram illustrating the hypothetical mechanism of TR and LXR crosstalk on the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054901.g009 Nowadays, the concept of subclinical hypothyroidism is widely accepted [63], [64], and it is assumed that AD patients with subclinical hypothyroidism could be increasing in number. On the basis of the data in the current study, for these patients, LXR agonists could be applicable as novel molecular therapeutic agents against AD since LXR compensates Seladin-1 gene expression under hypothyroid status.In conclusion, mouse Seladin-1 gene expression is positively regulated by TR-β and LXR-α at the transcriptional level and LXR-α compensates the gene expression in hypothyroidism and RTH. Thus, we have, for the first time, demonstrated TR/LXR crosstalk on the Seladin-1 gene promoter in the mouse forebrain. We believe that further analysis of the crosstalk could shed light on the role of TH and LXR agonist against AD.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Prof. Fredric E.

Formula display:￼AbstractBackgroundAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is intimately tied to amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Extraneuronal brain plaques consisting primarily of Aβ aggregates are a hallmark of AD. Intraneuronal Aβ subunits are strongly implicated in disease progression. Protein sequence mutations of the Aβ precursor protein (APP) account for a small proportion of AD cases, suggesting that regulation of the associated gene (APP) may play a more important role in AD etiology. The APP promoter possesses a novel 30 nucleotide sequence, or “proximal regulatory element” (PRE), at −76/−47, from the +1 transcription start site that confers cell type specificity. This PRE contains sequences that make it vulnerable to epigenetic modification and may present a viable target for drug studies. We examined PRE-nuclear protein interaction by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and PRE mutant EMSA. This was followed by functional studies of PRE mutant/reporter gene fusion clones. ResultsEMSA probed with the PRE showed DNA-protein interaction in multiple nuclear extracts and in human brain tissue nuclear extract in a tissue-type specific manner. We identified transcription factors that are likely to bind the PRE, using competition gel shift and gel supershift: Activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). These sites crossed a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). EMSA with PRE mutants and promoter/reporter clone transfection analysis further implicated PuF in cells and extracts. Functional assays of mutant/reporter clone transfections were evaluated by ELISA of reporter protein levels. EMSA and ELISA results correlated by meta-analysis. ConclusionsWe propose that PuF may regulate the APP gene promoter and that AD risk may be increased by interference with PuF regulation at the PRE. PuF is targeted by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1, which also interacts with the integrins. These proteins are connected to vital cellular and neurological functions. In addition, the transcription factor PuF is a known inhibitor of metastasis and regulates cell growth during development. Given that APP is a known cell adhesion protein and ferroxidase, this suggests biochemical links among cell signaling, the cell cycle, iron metabolism in cancer, and AD in the context of overall aging. Keywords: Amyloid precursor protein; Alzheimer’s disease; Cancer; Gene regulation; Gene transcription; Iron; Latency; nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase; Oncogenesis; PuF; SP1; Specificity protein 1; Transcription factorBackgroundA diagnostic feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is aggregation of toxic amyloid β peptide (Aβ) into extracellular plaques, suspected of causing or contributing to disease progression [1,2]. In addition, intracellular Aβ has been implicated as having a pathological role in AD and Down syndrome [3], and Aβ may function as a transcription factor (TF) [4,5]. Aβ is cleaved from a larger precursor protein (APP) by a process involving two secretase enzymes, β-secretase and γ-secretase [2]. Hyperphosphorylated τ protein and α-synuclein also have a likely role in AD etiology [6-8], and apolipoprotein E (APOE) is linked to a large proportion of cases of AD both by genetic [9,10] and cholesterol-related functional studies [11]. We hypothesize that unusually high production of Aβ significantly contributes to AD, and this aberrant Aβ production can result from unusually high APP gene (APP) expression, particularly in a tissue and cell-type specific manner. Several groups have studied the 5′-flanking region of the APP gene, including its promoter [12-16]. Serial deletion analysis has shown that the APP promoter [14,17] and 5′-UTR [18] contain several regulatory elements that are likely to modulate transcriptional activity. In addition to proximal regulatory regions, two upstream sequences have been identified that regulate the gene’s expression [14], including one that has been shown to generally stimulate APP production [19]. The APP promoter is regulated by a variety of factors. It can be stimulated by nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l [20,21], and copper depletion downregulates its activity [22]. A link between APP gene regulation and pathologies such as AD has been shown, for example, by characterization of two APP promoter polymorphisms associated with the pathogenesis of some forms of AD [23]. The more upstream of these two polymorphic sites may function as a target site for Aβ acting as a transcription factor [4,5]. Our group has examined regulatory regions of important AD-associated genes, including APOE[24,25] and microtubule-associated protein τ (MAPT) [26]. We have also previously characterized a deletion series of the APP promoter in eight different cell lines from five different tissue types in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct [27]. We discovered that a novel 30 nucleotide (nt) sequence of −76 to −47 from the +1 transcription start site (TSS) had differential effect depending upon cell line. In human kidney epithelial cells, deletion of this element resulted in 50-fold reduction of CAT reporter gene activity. In human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma (NB) cells, deletion resulted in a 3 to 4-fold gain of reporter gene activity, the greatest NB cell expression for all clones of the deletion series. We thus termed this region the “proximal regulatory element” (PRE) of the APP gene. We examined the nature of DNA-protein interaction with this DNA fragment by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA or gel shift). Notably, use of the PRE as a probe in EMSA showed evidence of DNA-protein interaction with this sequence in multiple cell line nuclear extracts and in mouse brain tissue nuclear extract [27]. However, the specific nature of nuclear proteins that interact with the PRE in different cell types was not determined at that time. We continue our work on the PRE by exploring specific DNA-protein interactions in EMSA, competition EMSA, and antibody-supershift EMSA. Functional effects were measured by creation of a library of mutant PRE sequences within a previously constructed [17]APP-CAT fusion clone. While we had previously shown that the PRE interacts with nuclear proteins in a tissue-type specific manner, we herein identified TFs that were likely bind to the PRE, specifically activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). We also characterized quantitative and qualitative effects of mutating the PRE vs. DNA-protein interaction in EMSA vs. both NB and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and cell nuclear extracts. Functional assays of PRE mutation effects were performed by transiently transfecting the mutant-CAT clones into human neuroblastoma and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma cell cultures. We discovered specific, significant mutation-dependent function differences. We compared the EMSA results to effects of the same mutations in functional mutant-CAT clone transfection assays. Altering the PRE’s ability to bind TF corresponded to functional changes in promoter activity in a cell line-specific manner. We determined that PuF and SP1 are candidates for regulation of the APP gene through the PRE. PuF’s better-known function is as an inhibitor of metastasis [28]. SP1 activity in APP regulation has already been well demonstrated [29-33]. SP1 sites have been located in both the promoter [13,32,34] and 5′-UTR portions of the APP 5′-flanking region [35,36]. Our data led us to propose that SP1 and PuF act antagonistically through the PRE, with SP1 stimulating and PuF repressing APP transcription. These two TF sites can be subject to natural variation in the human genome, as they cross a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [37]. The PRE sequence contains sites for DNA methylation and oxidation, suggesting the site may be vulnerable to environmentally-mediated epigenetic modification. Should such interference with PuF regulation of APP increase risk of AD, it would be another similarity between etiology of sporadic/idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders and oncogenesis, extending our previous work in developing the latent early-life associated regulation (LEARn) model [38,39] of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders. ResultsPutative transcription factor sites within the PREThe PRE with an additional 10nt flanking sequence at either end was used with TESS [40] and MatInspector [41] to probe the TransFac database [42]. Restricting predicted sites to mammal TF matrices and eliminating redundant sites resulted in predicted affinities with several transcription factors (Table 1), including AP2, GATA binding proteins 1 (GATA1) and 2 (GATA2), two GC boxes, paired box gene 4-a (Pax4a), PuF, Epstein-Barr virus transcription factor R (R), SP1, and transcription elongation regulator 1 (mammal homologue to zeste, TCERG1). Truncated upstream stimulatory factor (USF)1 and USF2 sites were also found at the 3′-end of the PRE. The GC box is associated with the binding of several transcription factors, including SP1, basic transcription element binding protein (BTEB)1, BTEB2, and msh homeobox 1 (Msx1). Table 1. Predicted TF sites in the PREDNA-protein interaction of the PRE by EMSA varies among tissue types and cell line conditions To investigate cell type specificity of PRE-protein interactions, we used the PRE fragment in EMSA with nuclear extracts from PC12 and human cervical epithelial (HeLa), SK-N-BE neuroblastoma (NB), and histiocytic lymphoma (U937) cells (Figure 1A–C) and with nuclear extracts from human tissues (Figure 1D). PC12 extracts (Figure 1A) were obtained from both normal and hypoxic cells (lanes 1–2). U937 extracts (Figure 1A) included nuclei from untreated cells and from cells treated with interferon (IFN)-γ, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or TPA + IFN-γ (lanes 3–7). In addition, to test specificity of PRE binding with untreated U937 extracts, we also competed the PRE/U937 EMSA against 200x molar excess unlabeled PRE fragment (lane 5). Nuclear extract EMSA showed definite interaction between the PRE and both PC12 and U937 extracts. This interaction was competed away with excess PRE in U937 extracts. DNA-protein interactions could be altered by specific treatment of cells from which extracts were taken. Hypoxia greatly reduced the observed interaction in PC12 extracts (lane 2). Treatment with the cytokine IFN-γ may have slightly increased interaction in U937 extracts (lane 4), but TPA treatment seems to have produced a stronger result (lane 6). Combined TPA+IFN-γ treatment (lane 7) reduced DNA-protein interaction levels, suggesting that more than one pathway may be involved in interaction with the PRE and that these interactions may compete with each other. thumbnailFigure 1. EMSA in stimulated and unstimulated cell culture nuclear extracts and vs. various transcription factor binding oligomers. A. Radiolabeled PRE was incubated with PC12 or U937 nuclear extracts. PC12 extracts were either normal (lane 1) or from cells subject to hypoxia (lane 2). U937 extracts were either normal (lanes 3, 6) or from INF-γ induced (lane 4), TPA-induced (lane 6), or TPA + INF-γ induced cells (lane 7). In addition, one sample of normal U937 extract was incubated both with labeled and 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE (lane 5). Arrows indicate major DNA-protein interactions. B, C. The PRE fragment from plasmid pβXbB was radiolabeled and incubated in NB or HeLa cell nuclear extracts with or without 200x molar excess competition against oligomers known to bind specific transcription factors. DNA-protein interactions are indicated with arrows. B. NB cell nuclear extracts. No competition (lane 1), competition vs. unlabeled PRE (lane 2), competition vs. unlabeled oligomers that bind AP1 (lane 3), AP2 (lane 4), SP1 (lane 5), or USF1 (lane 6). C. HeLa (lane 1) or TPA-stimulated HeLa (lanes 2–6) nuclear extracts. Reactions were subjected to no competition (lanes 1–2) competition vs. 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE fragment (lane 3), AP1-binding oligomer (lane 4), AP2-binding oligomer, or USF-binding oligomer (lane 5). D. EMSA of the PRE in four human tissue nuclear extracts. The DNA fragment corresponding to the PRE (−76/-47) was purified from plasmid pβXbB, radiolabeled, and incubated in nuclear extracts from human lung (lane 1), liver (lane 2), heart (lane 3), or brain (lane 4). DNA-protein interaction band is indicated by arrow. Unbound probe ran at the bottom of the gel (not shown). To narrow down candidate transcription factors predicted by TESS we conducted EMSA with 200x molar excess of unlabeled oligomer pairs known to bind the transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP1), AP2, and SP1, respectively. In addition, to demonstrate that the truncated USF1 site at the 3′-end of the PRE is not active, we competed against an unlabeled commercial oligomer pair known to bind USF1 (Figure 1B, C). Two assays were carried out under the same conditions, one each with nuclear extracts from NB (Figure 1B) and HeLa (Figure 1C) cells, respectively. In NB extracts, competition against AP1, SP1, and USF1 binding oligomer pairs (lanes 3, 5, 6) showed no difference with the uncompeted lane sample (lane 1). Competition with unlabeled PRE eliminated DNA-protein interactions (lane 2), while competition with AP2-binding oligomer pair reduced but did not eliminate interaction, suggesting that PRE interaction in neuronal cells may operate through more than one pathway or at least with more than one potential transcription factor. Competition EMSA in HeLa extracts was in TPA-treated extracts (Figure 1C, lanes 2–6). Comparing untreated HeLa nuclear extracts with TPA-treated extracts revealed that TPA induction changed DNA-protein interactions with the PRE (Figure 1C, lanes 1–2). Competition with the PRE nearly eliminated DNA-protein interaction (lane 3). Competition with oligomer pairs that bind AP1 (lane 4) and AP2 (lane 5) partially reduced DNA-protein interaction. Competition with the USFl-binding oligomer pairs showed little difference to uncompeted TPA-treated extracts (lane 6). These results indicate that the PRE may interact with AP2, at the very least, but AP2 is neither the sole interaction partner for the PRE in neuronal cells nor under phorbol ester induction. To directly explore tissue specificity of PRE interaction with factors present specifically in whole-tissue human organs in addition to cell cultures, we also carried out EMSA of the PRE fragment in human brain, heart, liver, and lung nuclear extracts. Two of the four extracts tested formed DNA-protein complexes with the PRE, specifically lung and brain extracts (Figure 1D lanes 1, 4). This suggests that the PRE is likely to have tissue-specific function in vivo, in addition to what may be suggested by cell culture results, and that the brain is at least one center of such affinity. DNA-protein interactions in NB nuclear extracts is TF specific by gel supershift EMSAFor further information on specific nuclear factors that would interact with the PRE, we performed supershift EMSA with radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs in NB nuclear extracts (Figure 2). Extracts were either untreated or co-incubated with antibodies against nuclear factors AP1, AP2, PuF, SP1, or combined AP2 + PuF. As negative controls, we incubated NB extracts with labeled PRE oligomer pairs and antibodies against USF1 or USF2. thumbnailFigure 2. Antibody supershift EMSA of PRE in NB nuclear extracts. Radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs were incubated with NB cell nuclear extracts (lane 1) and with extracts in the presence of antibodies against transcription factors AP1 (lane 2), AP2 (lane 3), PuF (lane 4), AP2 + PuF (lane 5), SP1 (lane 6), USF1 (lane 7), or USF2 (lane 8). Arrows indicate seven major bands. Incubation of PRE oligomers with NB extracts was not altered by co-incubation with anti-AP1 (lanes 1–2), primarily consisting of a single band. As predicted, anti-AP2 and anti-PuF each altered binding of the PRE with NB extracts (lanes 3–4). In addition to reducing the major DNA-protein interaction of un-competed PRE (band III), new DNA-protein interactions (bands V and VI) became visible when anti-AP2 was co-incubated. Co-incubation with anti-PuF produced a similar pattern to anti-AP2, with an additional band (IV). Of particular interest is that co-incubation with both antibodies reduced DNA-protein interaction more than did incubation with either antibody alone, and completely eliminated the interaction at band III (lane 5). Co-incubation with anti-SP1 produced a more classic “shift” response (lane 6, band I). Co-incubation with anti-USF1 (lane 7) did not result in any changes. Co-incubation with anti-USF2, on the other hand, produced a response similar to that found with anti-AP2 or anti-PuF. In addition, band II appears, but this band may also be already present but masked by the breadth of band III in untreated reactions. Close examination of lane I indicates that the interaction at band VI may also be present in untreated reactions. Bands IV and V, on the other hand, do not appear when the PRE is incubated with NB extracts in the absence of antibody or in the presence of AP1, SP1, or USF1 antibodies. These results indicate that AP2, PuF, SP1, and USF2 are all potential candidates for interaction with the PRE. Southwestern blotting with the PRE shows different DNA-protein interactions among different cell lines and conditions To ascertain sizes of proteins that participate in some of the observed interactions with the PRE, we performed southwestern blotting with nuclear extracts from NB, PC12, HeLa and TPA-treated HeLa cells (Figure 3). Probing with radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs revealed that DNA-protein interactions varied among extracts and were subject to induction. NB nuclear extract (lane 1) had major interactions at approximately 92, 33, 32, and 23 kDa (the last an extrapolation outside the range of the size standard). In addition, faint bands appeared at approximately 64, 51, and 39 kDa. The PC12 nuclear extract (lane 2) also had a 33 kDa/32 kDa doublet but lacked a 92 kDa interaction. Instead, an interaction at approximately 60 kDa appears. thumbnailFigure 3. Southwestern blot of PRE vs. cell line nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts from cell lines NB (lane 1), PC12 (lane 2), HeLa (lane 3), and HeLa treated with TPA (lane 4) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was probed with radiolabeled PRE oligomers. Blot photographs were size-equalized by use of the same lot of protein standards. Major bands are indicated with solid arrows. Minor bands are indicated with dotted-line arrows. PC12 also had weaker interactions at 92, 39, and 23 kDa. HeLa nuclear extract (lane 3) shared interactions at approximately 92 and between 33 and 32 kDa, with fainter bands at 64, 60, 51, 39, and 23 kDa. Induction of HeLa with TPA (lane 4) resolved the 33/32 kDa band into a doublet and reduced the strength of weaker interactions. Comparison of the observed southwestern bands with molecular weights of predicted transcription factors suggests the possibility that several of the predicted candidate transcription factors may bind to the PRE (Table 2). Table 2. Putative TF sites from southwestern blot based on estimated kDa of bandsThese comparisons were based on a ±10% adjustment to the calculated southwestern band kDa. Of the potential DNA-TF interactions, several appear for all nuclear extracts. These are AP2, Msx1, and USF1. A few are unique to human neuroblastoma nuclear extracts, specifically Pax4a, USF2, and BTEB2. There is no signal that can be assigned to PuF subunits, which would be around 17kDa in weight. This may be an artifact of the specific gel’s polyacrylamide percentage. However, the band VI/VII doublet could correspond to PuF dimers. In general, the southwestern does not exclude conclusions of our EMSA-based assays. Mutating the PRE alters DNA-protein interactionTo more specifically determine those sequences within the PRE that participate in gene regulation, we had synthesized a series of oligomer pairs that deleted one or more of the transcription factor sites we predicted to be in the PRE. These mutant oligomers were used for EMSA (Figure 4A, B) in both NB (lanes 1–8) and PC12 (lanes 9–16) cell nuclear extracts. Mutations resulted in both quantitative and qualitative alterations in DNA-protein interaction as determined by EMSA. Densitometry scans revealed that, at least for some mutants, such as M6, two partially overlapping bands appeared (Figure 4A, lane 7), and the wildtype oligomer pair has an extended trailing end to its peak, suggesting that wildtype binding is to more than one interaction partner. Semi-quantitative analysis, therefore, was done for all samples on each individual peak (division between peaks shown by dashed line in Figure 4A-C). thumbnailFigure 4. EMSA of wildtype and mutant PRE oligomers and semiquantitative analysis of EMSA. Wildtype and mutant PRE oligomers (M1-M7) were incubated with A. NB and B. PC12 nuclear extracts were analyzed on non-denaturing PAGE. Samples were analyzed in triplicate; figure presents a representative gel for each. Bands “I” and “II” as described in the main text are indicated. Dashed line indicates division made between band I and band II for densitometry purposes. C. Cross section of EMSA lanes. ImageJ software was used to evaluate densitometry of scanned films from EMSA of NB and PC12 nuclear extracts with various PRE variant oligomer pairs. Profiles of peaks for each PRE variant from a typical gel are shown. Dashed line indicates boundary between band I and band II for densitometry purposes. D–G. Densitometry readings for EMSA films were normalized to standard deviations and average readings for “wildtype” signal within each film as described in the main text. Normalized readings were compared to the wildtype reading by Dunnett’s multiple t. Means significantly different at p &gt; 0.05 indicated by “*”. D. Band I, NB extract. E. Band I, PC12 extract. F. Band II, NB extract. G. Band II, PC12 extract. Starkly visible qualitative differences were restricted to mutants M1, M4 and M6. The M1 mutants’ predicted binding sites had lower affinity for AP2, GATA1, PuF, one of the two predicted SP1 transcription factor sites, and a downstream GC box. The M4 mutant is predicted to lose the shared GATA1/GATA2 site and the downstream SP1 site, The M6 mutant loses a predicted binding site for zeste homolog/TCERG1. In the case of the first two mutants, the major DNA-protein interaction product’s migration was reduced compared to the wildtype oligomer pair’s primary interaction product (Figure 4C). Analysis of relative migration rates for the wildtype oligomer pair showed that migration of the DNA-protein interaction products for M1 (lanes 2, 10) and M4 (lanes 5, 13) were significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced from the relative migration rate of wildtype oligomers (lanes 1, 9). The M6 mutation (lanes 7, 15) produced two major DNA-protein interactions in EMSA. The peak of the slower-running interaction was significantly (p&lt;0.05) retarded in PC12 but not NB cells. Samples were processed and analyzed in triplicate and films densitometrically scanned. Densitometry results were normalized by subtracting the mean peak value for a single film and dividing by standard deviation for the film. For data presentation purposes, this was adjusted by subtracting the standardized value of “wildtype”, which sets “wildtype” value to 0 (Figure 4D–G, Tables 3, 4). Adjusted data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s two-tailed t. Hedges g standard pairwise effect sizes [43], using mean square error for pooled standard deviation, were calculated for each variant vs. wildtype PRE (Tables 3, 4). Table 3. Adjusted/normalized ELISA and EMSA signals in NB cells and extractsTable 4. Adjusted/normalized ELISA and EMSA signals in PC12 cells and extractsAnalysis revealed differences between mutation effects on each band’s signal strengths. Specifically, for band I (the slower-migrating band), the M1 mutant had significantly higher adjusted signal than wildtype in NB (Figure 4D, Table 3) nuclear extract. M2 in NB and PC12 extracts had significantly lower adjusted signal than did wildtype (Figure 4E, Table 4). For the dominant wildtype PRE EMSA band (band II), M3 and M7 had significantly higher signal than wildtype in NB (Figure 4F, Table 3) and PC12 (Figure 4G, Table 4) nuclear extracts, while M1 and M4 had significantly reduced signal in NB and PC12 extracts. Mutating the PRE in a reporter gene system produces specific functional differencesTo reveal connections between DNA-protein interactions and expression in mutations of the PRE, we constructed seven plasmids that mutated the PRE sequence identically to the mutant PRE oligomers. These cons-tructs were all based on pβXbB [17], which contains a promoterless CAT gene sequence under the control of an XbaI/BamHI fragment of the rhesus monkey APP gene promoter and 5′-UTR, specifically −309/+104, with +1 being the transcription start site (Figure 5A). Clones were transfected into PC12 and NB cell cultures as described herein. thumbnailFigure 5. ELISA of PRE variant CAT reporter clones in NB and PC12 cells. Functional differences of PRE mutant clones (M1-M7) from wildtype were assayed in NB and PC12 cells. A. pβXbB were constructed and transfected into NB or PC12 cell cultures as described in the main text. Cultures were harvested and analyzed by CAT ELISA. ELISA signals were normalized to “wildtype” values and subject to Dunnett’s multiple t. Means significantly different at p &gt; 0.05 indicated by “*”. B. ELISA of samples from NB cell cultures. C. ELISA of samples from PC12 cell cultures. Data presented is back-transformed from statistical analysis. Asymmetrical error bars and Dunnett’s t limits are due to Box-Cox transformation, when used. ELISA results of the functional assay were adjusted for β-gal levels and made relative to wildtype = 1. Adjusted results were compared to wildtype by Dunnett’s t, and Hedges g was calculated for each pairwise comparison (Tables 3, 4). Functional mutation effects in NB cells (Figure 5B, Table 3) were distinct from PC12 (Figure 5C, Table 4). In NB cells three mutants (M1, M5, and M6) had reduced reporter expression compared to wildtype, and mutant M3, had greater adjusted reporter expression than wildtype. In PC12 cells, mutants M1, M4, M5, and M6 had significantly lower CAT protein levels than wildtype. Mutating predicted locations of putative transcription factor sites in the PRE significantly alters reporter gene expression. These results were consistent between cell lines for the M1 and M5 mutants. Semiquantitative EMSA and ELISA specifically correlate by PRE mutantsWe compared EMSA and ELISA results by meta-analysis of pairwise Hedges g for ELISA and EMSA results vs. wildtype (Figure 6). For both NB and PC12 cells/ nuclear extracts, much weaker correlations were found between EMSA band I and ELISA signal (Figure 6A, B). Stronger correlations existed between EMSA band II and ELISA signal in both cell lines (Table 5; Figure 6C, D). Significance was estimated as chance that r ≠ 0 by bootstrap (500,000 repetitions). thumbnailFigure 6. EMSA vs. ELISA standardized effect sizes for PRE variants in NB and PC12 nuclear extracts and cultures. EMSA and ELISA results were used to generate Hedges pairwise g of comparisons of each mutant to wildtype PRE. Data was plotted with EMSA g on X axis and ELISA g on Y axis. Samples where both EMSA and ELISA signals were significantly different from wildtype at Bonferroni adjusted p &lt; 0.05 are indicated with corresponding mutant names. Correlations were bootstrapped (repeats = 100000), and frequency distributions of correlation coefficients are presented as insets. A. EMSA Band I vs. ELISA in NB extract/cells. B. EMSA Band I vs. ELISA in PC12 extract/cells. C. EMSA Band II vs. ELISA in NB extract/cells. D. EMSA Band II vs. ELISA in PC12 extract/cells. Table 5. Meta-analysis of PRE and mutant EMSA vs. ELISAThe percent overlap between the two bootstrap distributions within a single cell line was also calculated. The difference between correlations of EMSA I to ELISA vs. EMSA II to ELISA was more distinct in PC12 cells, with a 16% overlap between the two bootstrap distributions. In NB cells, the two bootstrap distributions overlapped by 34%. While there may be some indication of a direct relationship between EMSA band II signal and reporter ELISA results, we suggest caution in interpreting correlation meta-analysis. In addition to modest, at best, estimations of significance, EMSA bands I and II did not distinctly resolve on autoradiographs in many variants we studied, including wildtype (Figure 4). In addition, cell cultures used for ELISA and nuclear extracts used for EMSA did not come from the same specific cultures. Even with bootstrap estimation, they essentially represent correlations of averaged results from each assay. Nevertheless, we accept the possibility that some correspondence exists between altering the strength of the major DNA-protein interaction for the wildtype olig-omer pair (band II) and functional effects in reporter fusion assay. Mutating the PRE produces cell line-specific and inducible effects, as measured by EMSA To further investigate possible cell line/type-specific effects of the PRE, three mutants, specifically M1, M4, and M6, plus the wildtype PRE, were used as probes in EMSA with nuclear extracts from NB, PC12, human glioblastoma-astrocytoma (U373), HeLa or mouse embryo fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells. In addition, these oligomers were assayed with EMSA with nuclear extracts from HeLa, or NIH3T3 cells that had been subject to induction conditions, such as TPA treatment, serum starvation or induction with cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL6) or transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) (Figure 7). Three apparent bands, marked N (“null”/“zero”), I, and II, appeared among the various nuclear extracts, although no extract/mutant combination had all three bands. In nuclear extracts from NB cells (Figure 7, lanes 1–4), DNA-protein interactions were obtained as reported in 3.1. Wildtype oligomers produced a single strong interaction (lane I, band II). The M1 and M4 oligomer pairs each had an interaction that migrated more slowly than did the wildtype (lanes 2–3), while M6 had a mixed interaction, with bands that migrated both at the same rate as produced by wildtype and as by M1 (lane 4) oligomer pairs. The PC12 extracts (lanes 5–8) produced a pattern similar to that found with NB extracts, excepting that the DNA-protein interaction with M4 (lane 7) has a stronger “leading” edge to its band while the interaction with M6 has a weaker “trailing” peak in the band doublet (lane 8). thumbnailFigure 7. EMSA of PRE and selected mutants in NB, PC12, HeLa, NIH3T3, and U373 nuclear extracts. Wildtype oligomers (lanes 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33) and oligomers for the M1 (lanes 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34), M4 (lanes 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35), and M6 (lanes 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36) were labeled with γ−32P-ATP, incubated with NB (lanes 1–4) PC12 (lanes 5–8), U373 (lanes 9–12), HeLa (lanes 13–16), HeLa + TPA (lanes 17–20), NIH3T3 (lanes 21–24), NIH3T3 + serum restriction (lanes 25–28), NIH3T3 + IL6 (lanes 29–32), and NIH3T3 + TGFβ (lanes 33–36) nuclear extracts, and analyzed on nondenaturing PAGE, and gels subject to autoradiography. Interactions observed with U373 extracts (lanes 9–12) bore some resemblance to those observed with NB and PC12 nuclear extracts specifically for wildtype (lane 9) and M1 (lane 10). However, the M4 and M6 DNA-protein interactions (lanes 11, 12) were noticeably different from both NB and PC12. DNA-protein interactions seen with untreated HeLa nuclear extracts (lanes 13–16) did not apparently vary among PRE variants, but treatment of HeLa with TPA (lanes 17–20) resulted in a pattern of interactions that was more similar to those with NB and PC12 extracts. Untreated HeLa (lanes 13–16) DNA-protein interactions were unlike those found in the other cell lines surveyed. They had an additional band that migrated more slowly than seen for other cell line nuclear extracts. Interaction was very weak with the wildtype oligomer (lane 13), and it appeared as a doublet. The M1 mutant’s interaction was a single band (lane 14), while M4 and M6 interactions were doublets (lanes 14–16). Serum starvation of NIH3T3 (lanes 25–28) may have slightly reduced interaction with the M4 mutant (lane 27) but appeared to have no other effect. Treatment of NIH3T3 with IL6 (lanes 29–32) increases DNA-protein interaction with the M6 oligomer (lane 32, band I). Of particular interest, treatment of NIH3T3 with TGFβ (lanes 33–36) brought about a dramatic shift in DNA-protein interaction bands for the wildtype PRE and all three mutants. While interaction was visibly weaker than for other NIH3T3 based extracts, it very closely resembled that seen for normal NB (lanes 1–4) and PC12 (lanes 2–8) extracts. The PRE is well-conserved within the human genome and throughout eutherian mammalsTo explore the possibility that the PRE is well-conserved, we examined genomic sequences identified or putatively identified as proximally upstream of the APP gene of 35 mammal species that were aligned by WebPrank[44] as described herein. Information of the alignment was calculated in bits [45,46] and averaged in a window of 100 nt, which roughly corresponds to the distance between nucleosomes in chromosomal DNA as described herein. Examination of the alignment as a whole revealed that the PRE was well conserved compared to immediately flanking sequences. Adding non-primate sequences to the alignment did not change average information content immediately around the PRE (Figure 8A), but average information content for the alignment dropped off significantly (p &lt;0.05, Bonferroni adjusted for 4 comparisons) when on either side of the PRE. Information inversely expresses homogeneity, since 100% homogeneity at a given base is maximum possible score (2 bits) and equal distribution of all four bases would be 0 bits. thumbnailFigure 8. Multiple sequence alignment of APP upstream regions and test of molecular clock. DNA sequences from 20 mammal species were downloaded from GenBank and aligned with WebPrank as described in the main text. A. Average information content in a window of 100 nt and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for primates, euarchontoglires, boreoeutheria, eutheria, and mammals. B. Alignment was used as input for parsimony/FITCH combined phylogeny estimation as described in the main text. This produced a bifurcating non-ultrametric tree, although some branch lengths = 0. The tree was artificially rooted between marsupials and eutheria, and root-to-tip distances for each species calculated. Root-to-tip distances were compared to mean root-to-tip distance for the entire tree. Individual distances that differed from the mean distance (vertical solid line) ± the 95% (Bonferroni adjusted for 35 comparisons) confidence interval (vertical dashed lines) were counted as “significant”. Distances that significantly exceeded the mean indicated by “†”. Differences significantly lower than the mean indicated by “*”. Phylogenetic comparison of the alignment (−326/+202 in the human sequence) led, as expected, to rejection of the molecular clock hypothesis (Figure 8B). DNA changes observed within the, admittedly short, region are unlikely to occur simply through neutral sequence drift. Of particular interest is that most of the primate sequences appeared to have a slower-than-typical rate of change vs. the overall tree while mouse and rat sequences had a faster-than-typical rate of change. Further detailed examination was done of the alignment region immediately surrounding the PRE (Figure 9). Alignment was guided by a tree (Figure 9A) based on current conventional mammal phylogeny [47-49], as suggested by the WebPrank protocol. Sequences were taxonomically weighted as described herein and homologies between the human sequence vs. other primates, euarchontoglires, boreoeutheria, eutheria, and all mammals were calculated for the aligned PRE, as were sequence logos [46] for these groups (Figure 9B–F). The PRE remains fairly stable throughout the eutheria, with no less than 92.3% weighted homology to the human sequence (Table 6). Adding marsupials to the estimation reduces homology to 73.8%. Greater aggregate distance from primates also associates with lower specificity within the PRE (Table 6)—total information content (essentially expressing sequence specificity in terms of bits) drops from 49.04 for primates (including humans) to 39.36 when all mammal sequences are considered (Table 6). Of particular interest, the overlapping SP1/PuF site within the PRE is also well conserved among placental mammals (Figure 9E). However, the site breaks down when marsupial sequences are included (Figure 9F). Marsupials also have a 9–10 base insertion within the PRE (Figure 9F–G). thumbnailFigure 9.

Analysis of APP proximal promoter region multiple sequence alignmentDiscussionThe APP gene consists of 18 exons and spans more than 300 kilobases on human chromosome 21 [51]. We hypothesize that unusually high production of Aβ may contribute to AD, and this aberrant Aβ production can be a result of unusually high APP gene expression. The APP gene is a likely locus for sporadic, late-onset AD, the most common form of the disease [2,52,53]. Down syndrome patients invariably develop AD, which may be due to additional gene dose of the APP gene in the Down critical region of chromosome 21. In addition, cases of late-onset AD have increased plasma levels of the forms of Aβ [54] specifically associated with the disease. Tissue and cell-type specific expression of the APP gene may also play a role in APP protein or Aβ-related pathogenesis. It is well established that mutations in the APP coding sequence can cause autosomal dominant early onset FAD [55]. Some analyses of the coding sequence [56] and the promoter [57] rejected other APP polymorphisms as predisposing to late onset AD (LOAD). However, there are reports of promoter polymorphisms that increase risk for AD in a non-autosomal fashion [58,59], particularly of two polymorphisms in the APP promoter associated with AD pedigrees [23]. In addition, the following results strongly implicate the role of promoter elements in AD. 1) In a genome screen of 292 sib-pairs with LOAD, Hardy’s group identified 12 loci with lod-scores &gt;1 including a region on chromosomes 21 [60]. 2) Using non-parametric linkage methods, Duke’s group showed that a locus predisposing to LOAD might reside in this region of chromosome 21 [61]. 3) Levels of Aβ correlate to cognitive decline in predementia and dementia [62]. 4) Genetic analysis of a case of DS due to non-disjunction suggested triplication of APP in the pathogenesis of AD in Down syndrome [63]. 5) Younkin’s group analyzed plasma Aβ in 180 first-degree relatives of LOAD patients and in 82 age-matched controls. This analysis showed highly significant increase in plasma Aβ40/42 in the relatives as compared to controls [64,65]. Serial deletion analysis of the APP promoter has revealed several regulatory elements [14,17]. The APP promoter is regulated by several factors, including but not necessarily limited to nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l [20,21]. Copper depletion downregulates APP promoter activity [22]. Various groups have reported other transcriptional elements within the first 100 nt from TSS of the APP gene [19,34,66,67]. This includes regulation of APP promoter expression by two GC-elements [67], the zinc finger protein CTCF [66], and upstream stimulatory factor [19]. We previously reported discovering a 30 nt (−76/−47) fragment from a deletion series of the APP promoter with different effects depending upon cell line [27]. Our discovery was independently paralleled by other workers, who have noted a fragment of the APP promoter at −55/−33 by DNAse protection assay. This fragment was predicted to contain AP1 and AP4 binding sites, but both were experimentally excluded [15]. Furthermore, deletion of a −54/−42 fragment of the APP promoter resulted in reduced expression of reporter fusion clones [68]. In addition, deletion of a −77/−47 fragment resulted in reduced reporter fusion expression in rat primary embryonic hippocampal neurons [69], which was similar to our own observation of the effect of deleting the PRE in rodent cell lines and opposite what we observed in human cell lines [27]. This other work essentially concluded that USF was the responsible agent for regulation through this APP promoter fragment, although it did propose but not test a putative SP1 binding site. We do not dispute that USF may play an important role in APP proximal protein regulation but investigate the possibility that other factors and cofactors also operate on this sequence. We sought to more fully characterize the activity of the PRE as a component of the 5′-flanking region of the APP gene. Transcription factor binding activity was studied by EMSA with human tissue nuclear extracts, including extracts from human brain, followed by EMSA in four different cell line nuclear extracts under different conditions of stimulation or induction. Binding of specific TFs was tested by competition EMSA and by antibody-supershift EMSA. We also used Southwestern blotting to estimate molecular weights of interaction partners with the PRE and compared these with candidate transcription factors. We have determined that the PRE has tissue specificity, showing greater DNA-protein interaction with brain and lung extracts than with liver or heart extracts. In addition, the PRE has cell line-specific DNA-protein interactions with cell nuclear extracts, differing among U937, HeLa, U373, PC12, NIH3T3 cell lines. These interactions are subject to reduction, elimination, or qualitative change by conditions such as hypoxia, SR, and induction with TPA or IFN-γ), IL6, or TGFβ. Our results suggest that the −76/−47 region binds to a protein that is upregulated in serum starvation, and downregulated in hypoxia. Because serum starvation contributes to the induction of apoptosis, these results suggest a role of the 30-nt proximal APP promoter element in enhanced apoptotic neuronal cell death. Competition EMSA and antibody-supershift EMSA confirmed predicted interactions between the PRE and AP2, while antibody-supershift EMSA confirmed interaction between the PRE and AP2, PuF, SP1, and USF2. Competition and supershift EMSA appear to contradict each other regarding SP1. Possible biological explanations could include sufficiently high affinity within the PRE for SP1 to overcome competition with the particular commercial probe used. High PRE-SP1 affinity could result in a “negative” competition result but a positive supershift, since the supershift is meant to detect SP1 when bound to the target DNA. Alternatively, our supershift may be interacting with an SP1-like transcription factor that binds the PRE but has a lower affinity with the consensus SP1 site in the commercial competition oligomer. Southwestern blotting indicated possible interactions between the PRE and AP2, SP1, and USF2, among other TF. It also admitted the possibility of PRE-PuF dimer interaction. We mutated the PRE and highlighted a specific effect of the sequence that included the predicted PuF/SP1 binding site. Our mutant expression evidence tends to agree with our EMSA evidence. Of the mutants characterized, M1 was the most consistent in response across NB and PC12x cells and nuclear extracts. Specifically, semi-quantitative EMSA with M1 probe resulted in significant signal loss at the band position that corresponded closely to the major band of wildtype PRE EMSA in both NB and PC12 nuclear extracts. Likewise, M1 mutant promoter/reporter expression clones resulted in significantly reduced levels of CAT reporter protein in both NB and PC12 cells. The M1 mutant deleted the predicted PuF site and both predicted SP1 sites in the PRE. We note that M2 and M4 each also deleted a single predicted SP1 site, the specific site differing between M2 and M4. EMSA analysis of these two mutants showed that M4 consistently had reduced EMSA interaction at band II, while M2 did not. However, CAT reporter levels were not consistently altered between cell types. There-fore, our mutation analysis confirms our earlier conclusion that the PRE is most likely to function as a site of PuF and SP1 activity. Disruption of the shared PuF/SP1 site in our system resulted in reduced levels of reporter gene product, which appears to contradict part of our proposed model. However primary sequence disruption of the site would influence both PuF (repressive) and SP1 (stimulatory) interaction very strongly. In addition, disruption of the AP2 site also resulted in loss of EMSA signal, suggesting that the PRE may also function under induction as well as constitutively. Currently, two DNA sequence polymorphisms have been reported for the PRE, specifically rs200621906 and rs201592736 [37]. Each is predicted to alter potential TF binding sites within the PRE (Table 7). Of particular note, rs201592736 may interfere with the PuF site. In addition, potentially interesting sites were created, including glucocorticoid/progesterone receptor (GR/PR), NF1-like enkephalin nuclear transcription factor 1 (NKTF1) retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ), and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1),. Glucocorticoid levels are well associated with AD risk [70]. Progesterone supplementation has been linked to more rapid age-related cognitive decline in post-menopausal women [71,72]. Elevated levels of enkephalin contribute to neurological impairment and tau phosphorylation in AD model animals [73]. Upregulation of enkephalin accompanied by upregulation of APP due to an SNP in the PRE may overwhelm natural defenses against neurodegeneration. RARs direct APP processing toward the non-pathogenic α pathway [74], and it is conceivable that a feedback mechanism that results in RAR-mediated overproduction of APP in a natural PRE mutant may overwhelm this process. ZEB1 interacts with TGFβ [75], and TGFβ is implicated in AD pathogenesis [76,77]. The rs201592736 SNP approximates our M2 mutant, while rs200621906 approximates M4. Combining both polymorphisms approximates the TF deletion effects of M1, which showed significant Bonferroni-adjusted reductions in both EMSA and CAT reporter by meta-analysis. Population frequency of these SNPs has not been published, and it has not been yet determined if they occur as a haplotype or independently. It should be cautioned that, although they have interesting potential TF site changes, functional association with any disease state has also not been determined. Table 7. Natural SNP in the PREThe PRE is strongly conserved in placental mammals, particularly the PuF/SP1 overlapping site. In addition, this conservation occurs in a promoter region that has undergone significant non-neutral (i. e., non-molecular clock) change. In particular, primate and mouse/rat sequences diverge the most from each other in our root-to-tip ana-lysis, but with far less difference when considering the PRE, specifically. We propose that this particular short segment of the APP proximal regulatory region has been specifically maintained, as would be expected of an active promoter segment. We have previously stated that other AD-associated gene promoters, such as for APOE, have important differences between mouse and human [25]. Likewise, we have reported both differences and similarities between human and rat cell line responses to functional promoter deletion clones of the human MAPT promoter [26]. Such overall differences can be put to use in identifying potentially critical regions of similarity, such as the PRE within the APP promoter. Although two SNPs have been reported in the human PRE, it is unlikely, given their obscurity in the literature, that these would be common enough to explain a large proportion of sporadic AD. We propose that the majority of etiologically important PuF vs. SP1 disruption in the PRE would be due to environmental influences on epigenetic markers. The naturally-occurring SNPs could serve as a potential test bed, given their similarity in terms of TF site disruption to some of our synthetic mutants. It is potentially more interesting that the Puf/SP1 site consists primarily of GG and GGG sequences, which are particularly vulnerable to DNA oxidation [78]. While SP1 activity is sensitive to epigenetic DNA modification [79], and PuF operates in repair of DNA damage [80], relative effects of DNA oxidation upon each protein’s activity as a transcription factor have not been established. Likewise, CpG dimers (sites of cytosine methylation) are immediately adjacent to the PuF/SP1 site. Thus, in our system, while disrupting both PuF and SP1 activity by primary sequence mutation may result in overall reduction in reporter levels, environmentally-induced epigenetic alterations to the shared target DNA sequence may favor SP1 stimulation over PuF inhibition. In light of the knowledge that overall PuF activity may be reduced in AD, we do not suggest that epigenetic modification of the PRE would be the sole cause of the disorder. Rather, it would contribute to disruption of normal APP gene expression that would accompany AD. Feedback mechanisms between APP and other misregulated AD associated genes may serve to also reduce PuF activity in concert with direct disruption of APP-PuF interaction. We admit that our current assignment of PuF and SP1 to active status within the PRE has not yet been directly tested. Mammalian PuF is associated with inhibition of invasive metastasis [81-84] and stimulation of normal cell proliferation [85,86]. PuF kinase activity was reduced in human brain in Alzheimer’s disease and Down syndrome [87]. Total APP mRNA is elevated in AD brain, specifically KPI(+) isoforms [88]. APP gene expression and SP1 activity are increased in aging primate brains [31]. SP1-DNA interaction and APP expression in mouse brains are increased in a latent fashion by early-life dietary administration of Pb [29]. We suggest an antagonistic role between PuF and SP1, specifically that PuF may serve to downregulate APP gene expression via the PRE in vivo, and increases in effective SP1 activity, due to increased SP1 levels, interference in PuF-DNA interaction at the PRE, or decrease in PuF levels, for example, may overwhelm PuF regulation. The PuF transcription factor/kinase was discovered in the context of inhibiting metastasis [28]. Such inhibition included through interaction with the MYC gene promoter [89,90]. Later, PuF was determined to also function as a kinase independently of its TF activity [91]. PuF TF activity was determined to not only act to inhibit metastasis, but to also operate in non-metastatic cell proliferation [85,86]. In addition to cell proliferative activity, PuF regulates insulin secretion from pancreas islet cells [92], providing another molecular link underlying the recently-proposed metabolic-cognitive syndrome that may unite metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders [93]. We propose that these aspects of PuF may prove important in understanding both AD pathogenesis and the possibility that a role may be played by APP gene products in oncogenesis. Of greater interest is that PuF has already been indirectly linked to AD before our work with the PRE. PuF interacts with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1 (CAMK2N1) [94]. CAMK2N1 is, itself, a potent inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2), which is a mediator of learning and memory [95]. CAMK2 is currently a target of several anti-AD drugs under investigation [96]. Of particular note is that the PRE exists within a DNAse I hypersensitive region [97], and PuF activity is modulated by the presence or absence of a DNAse I hypersensitive region [87]. Likewise, among its amazing variety of functions [98,99], the APP protein is a ferroxidase and activates ferroportin to export iron from neurons [100]. Iron chelation reduces APP protein levels through the APP mRNA 5’-UTR [101], and this is reversed by iron supplementation. Conversely, overexpression of APP results in reduced iron content and increased oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma cells [102]. Although it has also been shown that abnormally high levels of iron accumulate in specific brain regions in AD, particularly within and around amyloid plaques [103], this is not paradoxical, since plaque-associated iron would be extracellular and could be in part due to overactivity of APP in iron transport. In addition, faulty iron metabolism has been strongly linked to cancer and neoplasia, specifically through ferroportin activity [104], and increased serum iron is associated with greater risk for oxidative damage to DNA [105]. Of particular interest for a possible oncology/APP association is that expression of the APP gene in response to iron chelators distinctly differed between neoplastic and normal cell lines [106]. In cancer patients, increased APP gene expression was more common in tumor tissue of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients than in non-cancerous matched tissue samples. More importantly, in those patients who had elevated APP expression, survival at 24 months was 48% vs. 82% for patients with non-elevated APP expression [107]. This suggests that PuF may exert anti-metastatic properties by, in part, altering levels of APP expression, reducing overall results of APP protein’s ferroxidase activity and modulating cancer risk. Basal activity of the APP promoter is greatest in neural origin cell lines, and several promoter elements close to the PRE are important for this activity [108]. For example, the APP promoter contains binding sites for important TFs, such as purine-rich element binding protein-α (PURα) [109] and early growth response 1 (EGR1) [110]. Notably, there is a high expression of PURα and EGR1 in neurons during brain development and in the adult brain, and negative regulation of APP gene expression by PURα [109]. ConclusionsInterference with TF binding to the PRE in the context of the complete APP promoter could serve to deregulate APP production. Deletion of the PRE from a complete series of APP promoter clones resulted in a 3 to 4 fold gain of promoter activity in NB cells as measured by levels of reporter gene product [27]. While AP2 and USF2 (implicated in our antibody supershifts) are generally stimulatory factors, the normal function of PuF is usually inhibitory of pathogenic cell proliferation, specifically metastasis [83,84]. In addition to inhibiting metastasis, PuF serves to induce normal cell proliferation [83,84]. The APP protein, among its non-pathological functions, is active in the “neuronal pruning” stage of brain development, wherein neurons in the early brain are selectively removed after rapid proliferation [111]. In addition to neurogenesis, PuF homologues regulate early morphological development [112]. Thus, as PuF serves to stimulate non-pathogenic cell proliferation, and APP can act to reduce cell proliferation, it is reasonable to propose the possibility that PuF acts to downregulate APP expression under normal circumstances, and interference in PuF regulation through the PRE could serve to deregulate APP gene expression, potentially contributing to AD pathogenesis (Figure 10). Aβ is a minority product of APP processing [113]. Therefore, increase in APP levels could raise Aβ above a risk threshold for AD. A theoretical union of oncogenic and neurodegenerative models has been proposed in the latent early-life associated regulation (LEARn) model of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders [38,39], expands and extends the “n-hit” model of pathogenesis commonly accepted in oncology to “sporadic” neurodegenerative disorders. Given that the predicted PuF site may be structurally vulnerable to GG oxidation, and thus subject to the LEARn model, we conclude that our work suggests connections between processes that lead to cancer etiology and sporadic neurobiological disorders, both conceptually (LEARn vs. n-hit) and mechanistically (PuF regulation of APP vs. PuF regulation of metastasis). thumbnailFigure 10. Model of Antagonistic PuF vs. SP1 regulation of the APP gene and disruption in AD. A. Non-pathogenic APP expression, levels regulated by PuF. In normal brain, PuF would compete with SP1 at the PRE and result in normal levels of APP mRNA and protein. Aβ would be restricted to non-pathogenic concentrations. B. Pathogenic APP expression resulting from disruption of PuF regulation of the PRE. Disruption of the PRE, such as through environmentally induced DNA oxidation at GG dimers, “*”, may reduce affinity of the PRE for PuF more severely than for SP1. Effective SP1 activity then serves to upregulate APP expression levels beyond a pathogenic threshold. MethodsReagents and enzymesUnless specifically noted otherwise, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) or Roche Life Science (Indianapolis, IN). Cell culturePC12 and NB cell lines were obtained from ATCC and cultured as described previously [114]. The plates were incubated in 5% CO2 in a 37°C incubator. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen/Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). PRE fragments and oligomersThe rhesus monkey APP promoter clone pβXbB [17] (Figure 11) was digested with restriction enzymes PvuII and XhoI and run on a 10% TAE-polyacrylamide gel. The cell type specific 30 nt (−76/−47) PRE [27] was purified and end-labeled with γ32P-ATP (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). In addition, oligomers corresponding to this sequence and its reverse complement were synthesized (Invitrogen) and similarly radiolabeled. The oligomer pair differs from the plasmid fragment in that it does not have a “TCGA” 5′ overhang. This overhang was filled for wildtype and mutant (see “Semiquantitative EMSA of mutant PRE oligomers…”, herein) synthetic double-stranded oligomers. thumbnailFigure 11. Clone pβXbB. A deletion series of 6kb of the APP promoter and 5′-UTR was previously constructed [17]. Within this series, an XbaI/BamHI 408bp fragment of the APP proximal promoter and 5′-UTR was inserted in the expression vector pBLCAT3 (Promega). This fragment contained the PRE. The clone was used as the base template for all mutagenesis described herein. Analysis of potential transcription factor binding sites on the PREThe TESS [40] and MatInspector [41] utilities were used to probe the TransFac database with the PRE sequence. EMSA of PRE fragments in human tissue nuclear extractsCell nuclei extracts from human brain, heart, liver, and lungs were prepared as previously described [115,116]. The assay was carried out with 40 pg of PRE from digestion of pβXbB (about 10,000 cpm) and 10 to 20 μg of nuclear extracts. Radioactive probe was incubated with human brain, heart, liver, or lung nuclear extracts in 24μl of EMSA-binding buffer (Active Motif, Carlsbad CA) at 6°–8°C for 40 minutes. The samples were mixed with loading dye and the products of the reaction were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in 1 x TGE (50 mM Tris, 384 mM glycine, and 2 mM EDTA). The gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography. Free oligonucleotides ran at the bottom of the gel. Protein-DNA complexes were detected as mobility-retarded bands. EMSA in nuclear extracts from normal and variously stimulated PC12 and human U937 cells Nuclear extracts were obtained commercially (ActiveMotif). PRE oligomer pairs were annealed and radiolabeled as described herein. Radioactive oligomer pairs were incubated with nuclear extracts from PC12, hypoxic PC12, U937, and U937 stimulated with either IFN-γ, TPA, or IFN-γ + TPA. In addition, one sample was incubated with U937 nuclear extracts and 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE oligomer pairs.

Financial challenges faced by person with dementia. The idea: A person with dementia and the family face many financial challenges. We need to emphasize economies of the cost of care. My name is Mike Donohue. I am just short of 75 years old, having been diagnosed five years ago. I have atypical AD. It is A-Typical because it is somewhat different than the norm. My memory is more intact than many, my cognition remains good as does my ability to read and write. Other limitations of the Alzheimer’s kind I do have. These keep me from driving, biking, handling money and doing more than one thing at a time. Alz.Org and other professional, social and charitable organizations, need to concentrate on formulating and developing programs of care that offer greater economy than those as now exist.  When a family is faced with its diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease it faces a variety of issues that need immediate resolution. One of these is the handling of their estate (their saved living and retirement funds) which may be irretrievably altered by reason of the current prognosis for care of the Alzheimer’s afflicted.   Financial Issues of First Facing This Disease.  Of the many things that need to be dealt with will be the following:     What will happen if the care needed has cost which the family is not able to pay?      Is there long term health coverage to pay this?     Does Normal Health Care coverage or Medicare provide any help?     Is the Alzheimer Afflicted able to continue working, earning the same salary? Is the spouse working earning income, is that enough to currently support the family?     If income of one subsides or of all of them reduce will the family be able to make it?     Where does the family go to fill the gap?  The Answers To These Questions Are Not Pretty!     The family’s private funds are normally the first source for payment of any cost of care not immediately covered by the insurance of the family.     Long Term Health Care coverage, if sufficient, if it specifically makes provisions, and is designed to run a sufficiently long time, will pay cost of care in the home and out of home care provided by agencies qualifying for reimbursement. This applies to most institutional Nursing Home and Assisted Living Facilities. It may apply to some day care and group home settings.     Health Care coverage and Medicare do not pay anything but immediate hospital and medically-related expenses provided as part of treatment. This most often does not include Nursing Home, Assisted Living facilities or equivalent styles of In House or Away from Home kinds of help.      In the event of diminution in earnings in the household because of the disease the private funds of the families are the first if not only source to make up the difference. Charitable or public assistance is predicated on the inability to pay and in many cases is difficult to get unless there is no other way.     If the family cannot make it, Public Assistance is available as well as assistance from many giving groups.     The problem is for those in-between.  Available Options. Long term health care seems worth every penny paid for it, if you have it. If you do not, with an Alzheimer’s diagnosis it is unlikely you can get it. But, remember, you get what you pay for, no more, no less. If you were smart enough and have it be sure it pays enough. Be sure it runs long enough. Be sure it covers Home, Assisted Living and Nursing Home Care.      Living Care: Some reimbursement of institutional Home care is pretty basic to all of the long term policies. Be sure in addition they cover cost of home care and cost of out of the home care not the normal institutional Nursing or Assisted Living care. Look at the type and kind of services it pays for. Does it pay for the normal group home, called foster home in some states? What are the qualifications, if any, for the home should payment for it be sought? The same applies to Home Care. Is the person who comes in to provide care qualified, certified, or, can just anyone provide the service required by simpler needs such as attendance, cooking, cleaning etc.?      Financial Planning:     Some financial planning with an expert is recommended. This is most important when it comes to evaluating the availability of Public Assistance. A need for care does not automatically produce Public Assistance. The law is very specific in determining where and how you qualify for it before you can get it.      In most cases the funds of the husband and wife seeking assistance (their entire estate) cannot exceed a little more than $100,000 between them. This may seem to be enough. It is not when you stop to consider this:  When the need for Assistance kicks in the current needs of the family don’t disappear, they continue. As an example: The husband, no longer earning income, needs daily attendant care. If the wife is home, able to give it that is not a new cost. In this situation the couple's living conditions do not change, they continue as they were.   The cost incident to the disease only goes up and too often is your obligation alone. What this means is: your current cost of living does not go down, if anything it goes up. Current cost of living mean the expenses other than the care expenses, such as home mortgage, monthly budget, the cost of the spouse not needing Care. These costs continue during the lifetime of both the husband and the wife. Circumstances change what those costs might be. They can go up, they can go down. We of course know their usual direction.  They will go down if the husband needs to go into assisted living or nursing home or some other out of home care facility. Without regard to who pays the cost of this the expenses do go down for the wife to the extent she no longer has to pay the eating and living expenses of the husband. She need no longer pay those costs incidental to his living at home. These are the only costs that stop.  When the husband dies the wife’s financial needs do not change appreciably with respect to herself. They continue. They continue her life time.  Now we come to totaling all of this to see how long that $100,000 lasts. Pull out your budget. What do you pay a month, a year? What of it will change if at all when one of you enters institutional care? Of the fixed amounts multiply them by the number of years of life expectancy the survivor is likely to live. Will it last?    Who Pays The Cost?  As these extra expenses escalate, who pays for them? You do. When can you ask for help? Anytime, anywhere, anyone can be asked. When are you entitled to help? Only when you have reached what the law calls the “Poverty Threshold.”  This threshold is when you own no more than around $103,000 total value of everything the husband and wife have. It was this amount when I checked with the experts in 2007. I believe it remains the same four years later.  Everything you have is just that! This includes bank accounts, retirement accounts face value of insurance policies, pension plans of which you are the owner not employer provided.   There are exclusions, not many, nonetheless there are. Your homestead up to $500,000 in some cases others up to 1,000,000 in value are excluded so long as the other spouse remains living in it. Certain annuities if they fit within a rigid definition of “purchase of income flow only annuities” with no right or restricted right of beneficiary appointment, these are excluded from the calculation of your estate.  If you have given it away more than five years before application for assistance is made it might qualify. By giving it away they mean just that. You must relinquish all incidents of ownership and control. This is available for irrevocable trusts only. It does not include revocable trusts. The law examines an irrevocable trust to see whether or the owner(s) have given up all control and no longer own the assets in an irrevocable trust. The essence in a revocable trust is that it can be revoked by the owner(s) and the assets returned to them.   Change.  What is needed is change.      Change in the style and cost of care.      Change finding more economical care.     Change of the existing infrastructure responding to the present needs produced by Alzheimer’s, not continuing to do something they do because that is the way they always did it.     Change of Public Assistance in the current compensation formulas.  These changes can run anywhere from qualification to supplemental provisions taking the form of more tax deduction and credit allowances, credits or incentives for public, private and non-profit ventures all directed to reducing the cost and increasing the availability of help for families faced with the overwhelming task of accommodating the alteration in their lives caused by Alzheimer’s.  It Is in the Public’s Interest.  It is in the public’s interests this be done. Alzheimer’s disease presents our short term future with a financial crisis that will devastate our already exhausted private and public capacity to pay its cost.  Proposals for Change.  What are sorely needed are lower-level care facilities and assistance programs. In whatever form, we need to consider and seek out greater economy of care in a variety of methods. We need to find alternatives to the high cost of institutional nursing home and assisted living of the facilities now provided.   Kinds of Care.  These can be but not limited to boarding and care homes, co-ops, foster homes, mutual help programs of people buying or renting a group home or grouping in same location apartments to hire and manage their own needs. Programs to support this are needed to help organize, facilitate and maintain these kinds of alternative care approaches. These could be supplied by private enterprise, charitable institutions or some lower level function than the Federal Government. This is being done in some areas; so much more is needed.   Tax Treatment.  Tax breaks and other public incentives are needed.  By history there has been a concentration of effort to remove any opportunity of anyone avoiding their personal obligation to pay for institutional care by forcing the government to do so. The history arose when the folks gave the farm to the kids, moved into the Nursing Home and applied for Old Age Assistance. They transferred the farm before they went in to avoid the county putting an Old Age Assistance Lien on it.  This may be as it ought to be. Nonetheless if private estates must first be drained of the funds needed by those depending on the person needing care, those dependents will continue to have the same economic need during and after the care is given the one in need of it.   The epidemic proportions of the issues associated with Alzheimer’s disease need attention. Tax deduction is needed for in home care, day care, respite care, any care in other forms. Deduction allowance is needed for the cost of care facilities. There needs to be a scheme to reward economy of costs in providing services. Other tax benefits are needed for programs to supplant the need of public funding for care. These need to be explored and the best of them provided.   Current Tax Treatment.  Although some deduction of cost of care facilities exists it is not clear, and too often is increased by the qualification processes that are needed so the deduction can be taken. This raises the cost of the service prohibitively.  Once qualified it is a question whether or not the person needing such care can deduct it if someone else made the payment for the service? Is the patient needing the care qualified to deduct it or is it the deduction of the caregiver requiring the additional help or making the payment? Can anyone deduct if they pay it? Who determines the qualification of the person in need before any deduction can be taken?  The tax breaks depend on the taxpayer entitled to the break having the income from which to take the break or income tax liability from which to take a credit. Many on fixed income fall between the cracks. They have too little income from too much estate to qualify for public assistance. This is but one of those open cracks. Some scheme of credits, rebates or something more direct needs to be considered for those who do not benefit from the deduction credit allowed against taxable income or tax liability.  Change Will Save The System.  We need to find a more economical way of providing care and respite for the Afflicted and the Affected before the Cost of Care bankrupts the system and puts everyone out in the street. The problems today with cost of living, health care and insurance costs, medical and hospital costs, the inability of our politicians to get it together in any meaningful way demonstrate what will come. Gridlock!  The prospect of what we all will face is magnified by the inability of our culture, institutions and governmental processes to provide care. The current insurmountable costs we have caring for ourselves without Dementia, namely living day to day, is already insurmountable. Keeping a job, paying the bills as middle class is squeezed into poverty class complicates it. This with all of the other difficulties creates an impossible situation. How then are we to meet this coming crises bearing down on us at breakneck speed?   If we are unable to find a cure for this disease quickly there will be no funds left with which to seek Economy of Care. The coming increase of people needing care because of this disease is frightening.

First published December 3, 2012Received for publication April 26, 2012, and accepted in revised form September 27, 2012.Deposition of amyloid β protein (Aβ) to form neuritic plaques in the brain is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ is generated from sequential cleavages of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the β- and γ-secretases, and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the β-secretase essential for Aβ generation. Previous studies have indicated that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) may play a role in APP processing by modulating γ-secretase activity, thereby facilitating Aβ production. There are two highly conserved isoforms of GSK3: GSK3α and GSK3β. We now report that specific inhibition of GSK3β, but not GSK3α, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP and Aβ production by decreasing BACE1 gene transcription and expression. The regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3β was dependent on NF-κB signaling. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling markedly reduced Aβ deposition and neuritic plaque formation, and rescued memory deficits in the double transgenic AD model mice. These data provide evidence for regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis by GSK3β and that inhibition of GSK3 signaling can reduce Aβ neuropathology and alleviate memory deficits in AD model mice. Our study suggests that interventions that specifically target the β-isoform of GSK3 may be a safe and effective approach for treating AD. IntroductionAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. The characteristic neuropathological features of AD include neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Amyloid β protein (Aβ), the central component of neuritic plaques, is produced from sequential endoproteolytic cleavages of the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase and γ-secretase. Proteolytic processing of APP at the β site is essential for generating Aβ, and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the β-secretase in vivo (1–4). BACE1 cleaves APP at two β-sites, Asp+1 and Glu+11 of the Aβ domain, to generate C99 and C89 fragment, respectively (5). Subsequently, γ-secretase cleaves C99 within its transmembrane domain to release Aβ and APP C-terminal fragment γ (CTFγ). In addition to APP, BACE1 substrates also include other proteins: LRP (6), APLP1 (7), APLP2 (8), ST6Gal I (9), and PSGL-1 (10). BACE1 expression is tightly regulated at the level of transcription (5, 11, 12) and translation (13–16). It was reported that a G/C polymorphism in exon 5 of the BACE1 gene might be associated with some sporadic cases of AD (17–19). Although genetic analyses from our and other laboratories have failed to uncover any mutation in the BACE1 coding sequence or any disease-associated SNP in its promoter region in AD patients (20–22), increased β-secretase levels and activity have been reported in AD (23–27). BACE1 levels were elevated in neurons around plaques (28). BACE1 mRNA levels tended to increase as miR-107 levels decreased in the progression of AD (29). We reported that hypoxia, a common vascular component among AD risk factors, increased BACE1 expression, resulting in both increased Aβ deposition and memory deficits in AD transgenic mice (30). Recently we found that both NF-κB and BACE1 levels were increased in sporadic AD patients, and NF-κB facilitated BACE1 gene expression and APP processing (27). Thus, increased BACE1 expression by NF-κB signaling in the brain could be one of the mechanisms underlying AD development (27). Together, these studies indicate that BACE1 dysregulation plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. BACE1 has been considered as one of the major targets for AD drug development. Bace1-knockout mice have abolished Aβ generation (31–33). Suppression of BACE1 by RNA interference reduced APP processing and Aβ production in primary cortical neurons derived from both wild-type and Swedish APP mutant transgenic mice (34), and disruption of the Bace1 gene rescued memory deficits and cholinergic dysfunction in Swedish APP mice (35). Oral administration of a potent and selective BACE1 inhibitor decreased β-cleavage and Aβ production in APP transgenic mice in vivo (36). Bace1-KO mice were reported to display hypomyelination of peripheral nerves and aberrant axonal segregation (37, 38), suggesting that inhibiting β-secretase may have unwanted collateral effects. However, even a partial reduction in BACE1 can have dramatically beneficial effects on AD pathology (39), suggesting that therapeutic inhibition of BACE1 is a valid therapeutic target for AD treatment. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase originally identified as playing an important role in glycogen metabolism. Since its discovery, many studies have shown that GSK3 has pleiotropic functions, including embryonic development, gene transcription, and neuronal cell function (40). In mammals, two GSK3 isoforms are encoded by distinct genes: GSK3A produces a 51-kDa GSK3α protein and GSK3B a 47-kDa GSK3β protein (41). These two isoforms are highly homologous, sharing greater than 95% amino acid identity in the catalytic domains. Although both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, the β isoform is expressed at higher levels in neuronal tissues (42). GSK3 activity is regulated at several levels. Phosphorylation of Tyr279/Tyr216 on GSK3α/β is important for enzymatic activity (43). Inactivation of GSK3 can be achieved through phosphorylation of Ser21/Ser9 residues within the N-terminal domain on GSK3α/β, respectively. Stimulation of tissues by insulin and growth factors activates the PI3K/PKB/Akt signal transduction cascade, leading to phosphorylation of these inhibitory serine residues (44, 45). GSK3 is also regulated upon interaction of the Wnt ligand and its receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6. This interaction releases GSK3 from a multi-protein complex formed by β-catenin, axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (46, 47), which prevents GSK3-mediated β-catenin degradation and induces β-catenin–dependent gene transcription. Dysregulation of GSK3 activity has been implicated in AD. Increased GSK3β activity was found in postmortem AD brains (48). GSK3β has been found to phosphorylate the tau protein on various conserved sites and contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation (49, 50). GSK3α was reported to regulate Aβ production by positively modulating the γ-secretase complex (51), although this finding has recently been challenged (52). Inhibition of GSK3 activity with the commonly known GSK3 inhibitors LiCl and valproic acid in cell culture (53) and animal models of AD decreased Aβ production (51, 54). Although LiCl and valproic acid are known to inhibit GSK3 activity, these compounds also activate a plethora of signaling cascades that could differentially regulate APP processing independent of GSK3 (55–58). In this study, we examined the effects of GSK3β-specific inhibition on AD neuropathology and behavioral deficits and identified its underlying mechanism. We found that specific inhibition of GSK3β, but not GSK3α, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP. Treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor AR-A014418 (ARA) reduced neuritic plaque formation and alleviated memory deficits in AD transgenic model mice. Furthermore, we found that GSK3β regulated BACE1 transcription via NF-κB signaling. Our work provides evidence that specific inhibition of GSK3β may be an effective therapeutic approach for treating AD. ResultsRegulation of β-secretase cleavage of APP and Aβ production by GSK3 signaling. Previous studies showed that LiCl and valproic acid modulated GSK3 signaling and reduced Aβ production (51, 54). However, the underlying mechanism is not well defined, and these compounds also have many confounding GSK3-independent effects. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on APP processing, we applied ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3, to 20E2 cells, a stable cell line expressing human Swedish mutant APP (5). ARA at 1, 2.5, and 5 μM significantly decreased the levels of the β-secretase cleavage product APP C99 to 95.7% ± 1.6%, 66.4% ± 0.7%, and 31.3% ± 0.4%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1A and B). The treatment had no significant effect on APP expression (Figure 1A). The Aβ ELISA was performed to assess the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the conditioned media of 20E2 cells. ARA markedly reduced Aβ generation in a dose-dependent manner. Aβ40 was decreased to 99.2% ± 3.8%, 73.2% ± 4.6%, and 48.7% ± 1.3% with 1, 2.5, and 5 μM of ARA treatment, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 1C); and Aβ42 was reduced to 99.2% ± 3.1%, 73.2% ± 3.5%, and 48.7% ± 4.5% with 1, 2.5 and 5 μM of ARA treatment, respectively (P &lt; 0.01 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1D). As expected, inhibition of GSK3 stabilized β-catenin (Figure 1A), and ARA treatment resulted in a significant increase in β-catenin levels to 152.7% ± 11.1%, 221.3% ± 17.0%, and 233.7% ± 25.0% with 1, 2.5, and 5 μM, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). These data indicate that specifically inhibiting GSK3 reduced BACE1-mediated APP processing and C99 and Aβ production. Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP.Figure 1Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP. (A) Swedish mutant APP stable cell line 20E2 was cultured and treated with ARA for 24 hours, and cell lysates subjected to Western blot analysis. Full-length APP and the APP CTFs were detected with C20 antibody. β-Catenin was detected by anti–β-catenin antibody. β-Actin was detected by anti-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification of APP C99 generation in 20E2 cells.

Co-treatment with specific GSK3 inhibitors ARA and G2 reduced C99. Con, control. (F) Quantification of C99 levels. n = 6; *P &lt; 0.05, ANOVA. To further examine the effect of GSK3 on β-secretase cleavage of APP and Aβ production, we pharmacologically blocked γ-secretase activity with the γ-secretase–specific inhibitor L658,458 in 20E2 cells while co-treating with the GSK3 inhibitor ARA and G2. G2 is another structurally distinct GSK3 inhibitor, with an IC50 of 304 nM (59). As expected, γ-secretase inhibition resulted in markedly increased generation of the APP CTFs C83 and C99 (Figure 1E). Addition of ARA or G2 reduced C99 levels to 78.2% ± 1.1% and 63.9% ± 6.6% (Figure 1, E and F). ARA treatment had no significant effect on Notch cleavage (Supplemental Figure 1B; supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI64516DS1). These data demonstrated that specific inhibition of GSK3 reduced β-secretase cleavage of APP to generate C99 and Aβ production in cells. GSK3β but not GSK3α regulates BACE1 gene expression and BACE1-mediated APP processing. Our study has shown that GSK3 regulated β-secretase processing of APP, an essential step for Aβ generation. Since BACE1 is the β-secretase in vivo, we first examined whether GSK3 affects BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 has two highly homologous isoforms, GSK3α and GSK3β. We used RNA interference to specifically knock down the expression of GSK3α or GSK3β isoforms in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to determine whether both isoforms or one of the isoforms play a major role in regulating BACE1 gene expression. Specific knockdown of GSK3β expression by the siRNA significantly reduced BACE1 mRNA levels to 76.0% ± 6.6% as compared with control (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B), whereas knockdown of GSK3α did not affect BACE1 mRNA expression (P &gt; 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B). Additional exogenous expression of GSK3β rescued the reduction of BACE1 expression resulting from knockdown of GSK3β by siRNA (Supplemental Figure 2). To examine whether specific knockdown of GSK3β expression also affected β-secretase processing of APP, we transfected siRNA specific to GSK3α or GSK3β into 20E2 cells while inhibiting γ-secretase activity with L658,458. Western blotting showed that GSK3α or GSK3β siRNA specifically reduced GSK3α or GSK3β expression, respectively (Figure 2C). Knockdown of GSK3α expression did not significantly affect BACE1-mediated APP processing, whereas GSK3β knockdown reduced the production of the BACE1 cleavage product C99 to 51.9% ± 6.4% (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 2, C and D). GSK3β, but not GSK3α, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing.Figure 2GSK3β, but not GSK3α, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing. (A) SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with scrambled GSK3α or GSK3β isoform–specific siRNA. RNA was extracted, and semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to measure endogenous human BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, and β-actin mRNA levels with specific primers recognizing the coding sequence of each gene. PCR products after 28 cycles were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel. (B) Endogenous BACE1 mRNA was significantly reduced with GSK3β, but not GSK3α, isoform–specific knockdown. The values are expressed as mean ± SEM. n = 3; *P &lt; 0.05, Student’s t test. (C) 20E2 cells were transfected with scrambled or GSK3α, or GSK3β isoform–specific siRNA while cotreated with L685,458 to block γ-secretase activity. Full-length APP and CTF fragments were detected with C20 antibody. GSK3α and GSK3β were detected using a monoclonal GSK3α/β antibody. GSK3α and GSK3β isoforms were selectively reduced by the isoform-specific siRNA. β-Actin served as an internal control and was detected using a monoclonal anti–β-actin antibody, AC-15. (D) GSK3β-specific knockdown significantly reduced C99 levels. GSK3α-specific knockdown did not have any significant effect. The values are expressed as mean ± SEM. n = 4; *P &lt; 0.05, Student’s t test. (E) Tetracycline-regulated SHSY5Y cells were induced to express constitutively active S9A-GSK3β. Endogenous human BACE1 mRNA levels were assessed as described above. Tetracyline-induced S9A-GSK3β significantly increased BACE1 expression. (F) Quantification of the endogenous BACE1 mRNA level. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. n = 4; *P &lt; 0.05, Student’s t test. To further confirm that GSK3β regulates BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we assayed BACE1 mRNA in the S9A-GSK3β inducible SHSY5Y stable cell line. This stable cell line carries the constitutively active mutant GSK3β, and expression of the mutant gene is under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (60). Addition of tetracycline induced the expression of active GSK3β (Figure 2E) and resulted in significantly increased expression of BACE1 to 251.1% ± 70.0% relative to the control (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 2F). These data demonstrated that GSK3β, but not GSK3α, specifically regulates BACE1 gene expression and contribute to APP processing. GSK3β regulates BACE1 gene promoter activity. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of GSK3β on BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we performed a BACE1 gene promoter assay. Two human BACE1 gene promoter deletion plasmids were constructed. Regions of the BACE1 promoter from –2890 to +292 bp (pB1-A) and from –9 to +292 bp (pB1-B) were inserted into promoterless vector pGL3-basic upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Figure 3A). To examine the effect of GSK3 on BACE1 gene promoter activity, we transfected N2a cells with pB1-A and then treated them with ARA. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling by ARA significantly decreased the promoter activity of pB1-A in N2a cells to 54.9% ± 6.2% (P &lt; 0.005) (Figure 3B). To further investigate the underlying mechanism and determine the BACE1 promoter region that mediates the transcriptional activation by GSK3 signaling, we co-transfected N2a cells with either pB1-A or pB1-B plasmid together with the S9A-GSK3β plasmid, which carries a constitutively active form of GSK3β. Expression of active GSK3β markedly increased the luciferase activity of pB1-A in the S9A-GSK3β transfected cells to 144.0% ± 2.0% as compared with the control (P &lt; 0.05), but had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (P &gt; 0.05) (Figure 3C). This result showed that enhancing GSK3β signaling upregulated BACE1 gene promoter activity and the 2.8-kb promoter region is responsible for GSK3β-mediated upregulation of BACE1 transcription. To further confirm this finding, we transfected these two deletion promoter plasmids into Gsk3b-KO or wild-type cells. Ablation of Gsk3b expression in the Gsk3b-KO cells resulted in significant reduction in luciferase activity of pB1-A to 47.0% ± 7.5% as compared with the wild-type control cells (P &lt; 0.01) (Figure 3D). However, knockout of the Gsk3b gene had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (Figure 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that GSK3β regulates BACE1 gene expression via its effect on the BACE1 promoter. GSK3β regulates BACE1 promoter activation.Figure 3GSK3β regulates BACE1 promoter activation. (A) Schematic of the 3.3-kb (pB1-A) and 300-bp (pB1-B) human BACE1 promoter/luciferase construct. (B) The 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter was transfected into N2a cells and treated with 5 μM ARA. GSK3 inhibition with ARA treatment resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity. (C) N2a cells were co-transfected with either promoter constructs and S9A-GSK3β or a vector control. S9A-GSK3β significantly increased the luciferase activity of the 3.3-kb BACE1 promoter construct but did not have any effect on the 300-bp promoter construct. (D) pB1-A or pB1-B constructs were transfected into Gsk3b-KO MEFs. pB1-A had significantly reduced promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. n = 4; *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.005, Student’s t test. NF-κB mediates the transcriptional regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3β. Recently we reported that levels of both BACE1 and NF-κB are increased in AD brains, and NF-κB signaling upregulates human BACE1 gene expression by acting on the cis-acting p65-binding element in its promoter (27). Previous studies in Gsk3b-KO mice demonstrated that GSK3β is required for proper activation of NF-κB (61). As our data indicate that GSK3β regulates BACE1 gene transcription, we next examined whether regulation of BACE1 transcription by GSK3β signaling is dependent on NF-κB. TNF-α is a strong activator of NF-κB p65 expression. In order to examine the specific role of NF-κB in GSK3β-regulated BACE1 transcription, we transfected N2a cells with a pBACE1-4κB promoter plasmid that contained only the NF-κB–binding elements in the human BACE1 promoter (27). After transfection, the cells were cotreated with TNF-α and the GSK3 inhibitor ARA. ARA treatment alone consistently reduced BACE1 promoter activity (Figure 4A). TNF-α stimulation increased pB1A promoter activity to 132.6% ± 7.5% of the control (P &lt; 0.01). However, ARA treatment reduced the TNF-α–induced BACE1 promoter activation to 115.6 ± 6.9% as compared with TNF-α treatment alone (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 4A). Overexpression of p65 NF-κB significantly increased the BACE1 promoter activity to 487.1% ± 102.2% as compared with the control (P &lt; 0.001) (Figure 3D). However, ARA did not affect NF-κB p65’s upregulating effect on BACE1 promoter activity (P &gt; 0.05), indicating that GSK3 signaling may have its effect upstream of NF-κB in the modulation of BACE1 transcription (Figure 4B). To further confirm ARA’s effect on NF-κB activity, we co-transfected N2a cells with pNF-κB–Luc and NF-κB p65 or an empty vector, followed by treatment with ARA to inhibit GSK3 signaling. ARA reduced pNF-κB-Luc promoter activity to 51.9% ± 9.1% as compared with control (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 4C). Overexpression of NF-κB p65 significantly increased pNF-κB–Luc promoter activity to 203.36 ± 87.38–fold (P &lt; 0.001) (Figure 4C). Additional ARA treatment did not have any significant effect on the transcriptional activation of pNF-κB–Luc by NF-κB p65 overexpression (P &gt; 0.05) (Figure 4C). These data indicate that the p65-binding elements in the BACE1 promoter mediated the effect of GSK3β on BACE1 transcription. GSK3β regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-κB p65 expressioFigure 4GSK3β regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-κB p65 expression. (A) pBACE1-4NF-κB plasmid contains the 4 NF-κB cis-elements from the human BACE1 promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-κB and pCMV-RLuc. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle solution (control) or 10 ng/ml TNF-α with/without 5 μM ARA for 24 hours. (B) N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-κB plasmid and pMTF-p65 or a vector control. Transfected cells were then treated with a vehicle solution or 5 μM ARA for 24 hours.

(D) Wild-type MEFs and RelA-KO MEFs which are dysfunctional for NF-κB activity, were co-transfected with a 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter and S9A-GSK3β or a control vector. S9A-GSK3β overexpression in MEFs. significantly increased luciferase activity (*P &lt; 0.05, Student’s t test), whereas RelA-KO MEFs did not have any significant effect. Luciferase activity is indicative of BACE1 promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. (E) N2a cells were treated with 5 μM ARA for 24 hours, followed by cell fractionation. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. ARA treatment significantly reduced NF-κB p65 levels in the (F) nuclear fraction (n = 6; **P &lt; 0.001, Student’s t test) and (G) cytosolic fraction. n = 6; ***P &lt; 0.001, Student’s t test. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. To confirm the role of the NF-κB signaling pathway in GSK3β-mediated BACE1 transcription, we transfected NF-κB p65 knockout RelA-KO cells and wild-type control cells with the BACE1 promoter pB1-A and the constitutively active GSK3β expression plasmid S9A-GSK3β. In wild-type cells, activation of GSK3β signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3β markedly increased BACE1 promoter activity to 189.6% ± 20.9% as compared with the vector control (P &lt; 0.05), whereas activation of GSK3β signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3β had no effect on BACE1 promoter activity in RelA-KO cells (P &gt; 0.05) (Figure 4D), indicating that disruption of NF-κB p65 expression in RelA-KO cells abolished GSK3β’s effect on the transcriptional activation of the human BACE1 gene promoter. To further examine the effect of GSK3 inhibition on NF-κB p65 expression, we treated N2a cells with ARA and subjected them to subcellular fractionation (Figure 4E). ARA treatment significantly reduced nuclear NF-κB p65 levels to 46.9% ± 9.1% as compared with control (P &lt; 0.01) (Figure 4F). Moreover, ARA treatment also reduced cytosolic NF-κB p65 levels to 56.1% ± 7.1% as compared with control (P &lt; 0.001) (Figure 4G). These data show that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced NF-κB activity by decreasing NF-κB p65 levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NF-κB signaling mediates the regulatory effect of GSK3β on BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 regulates BACE1 gene expression, APP processing, and Aβ production in vivo. Our data provide strong evidence that GSK3β activates BACE1 gene expression, resulting in enhanced β-secretase processing of APP and Aβ production in vitro. To examine the effect of GSK3 signaling on BACE1 gene expression and APP processing in vivo, we first assayed APP CTFs and Aβ production in the brain of APP23/PS45 mice by Western blot analysis (Figure 5, A and B). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, an AD mouse model, were generated by crossing APP23 mice, carrying the human Swedish mutant APP751 transgene driven by the neuron-specific Thy1.2 promoter, and PS45 mice, carrying the human familial AD–associated G384A mutant presenilin-1 (PS1) (54). The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg of the GSK3 inhibitor ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. ARA treatment significantly decreased the brain levels of the β-secretase–generated CTFβ fragments C99 and C89, to 38.4% ± 4.8% relative to controls (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 5B). The levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were reduced to 71.2% ± 8.3% and 65.6% ± 11.0% in ARA-treated mice relative to controls, (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 5, C and D). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 activity by ARA treatment reduces β-secretase cleavage of APP and Aβ production in vivo. ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and Aβ production in vivo.Figure 5ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and Aβ production in vivo. (A) Hemi-brains from ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice of the 6 weeks age group were homogenized in RIPA-Doc lysis buffer and separated with 12% Tris-glycine or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE. Full-length APP and APP CTFs (C99 and C89) were detected by C20 polyclonal antibody. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. BACE1 was detected by anti-BACE1 antibody. β-Actin was detected by anti–β-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification showed that CTFβ was significantly decreased in ARA-treated mice. n = 25 mice total. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, Student’s t test. ELISA was performed to measure Aβ40 (C) and Aβ42 (D) levels from the brain tissues of APP23/PS45 mice injected with or without ARA. n = 8 for each group; *P &lt; 0.005, Student’s t test. (E) Total RNA was isolated from APP23/PS45 mouse cortices by TRI Reagent. Sets of gene-specific primers were used to amplify Bace1 (E), PS1 (G), and App (I) genes. β-Actin was used as an internal control. Bace1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced (F), while there were no difference in endogenous PS1 (H) or App (J) mRNA levels between ARA-treated mice and controls. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. n = 12 total; *P &lt; 0.01, Student’s t test. We then examined whether the level of BACE1 was altered by GSK3 signaling in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly reduced the protein level of BACE1 to 64.7% ± 7.3% in ARA-treated mice, as compared with the control mice (P &lt; 0.01), and the treatment had no significant effect on APP and PS1 protein levels (P &gt; 0.05) (Figure 5, A and B). We further showed that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced tau phosphorylation, which is consistent with previous findings (ref. 62 and Supplemental Figure 1A). Our in vitro study has shown that GSK3β regulates the transcription of the BACE1 gene. To confirm that the decrease in BACE1 protein level seen in the brains of the ARA-treated mice was due to reduced BACE1 gene transcription, the endogenous Bace1 mRNA levels were measured (Figure 5, E, G, and I). ARA treatment markedly reduced Bace1 mRNA level to 36.7% ± 11.8% (P &lt; 0.01) (Figure 5F), but did not significantly change the mRNA levels of App and PS1 genes (P &gt; 0.05) (Figure 5, H and J). These data demonstrate that, consistent with the in vitro results, inhibition of GSK3 specifically inhibited Bace1 gene expression and its β-secretase activity in vivo. Our study has demonstrated that NF-κB signaling is required for GSK3β’s regulatory effect on BACE1 gene expression in vitro. To confirm this effect in vivo, we examined whether NF-κB activity was affected in APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice administered ARA. EMSA was used to assess NF-κB consensus DNA binding in whole brain lysates. ARA treatment inhibited the binding of NF-κB p65 protein to the cis-acting consensus oligonucleotide probe, resulting in a reduction in the intensity of the p65 NF-κB shifted bands (Figure 6A). The specificity of the bands was confirmed by competition assay with addition of ×10 and ×100 unlabeled wild-type NF-κB oligonucleotides (oligos), while the mutant NF-κB oligos did not have any significant effect on the shifted bands (Figure 6B). Consistent with the in vitro experiment, APP23/PS45 mice receiving ARA treatment showed a significant reduction in NF-κB levels to 62.9% ± 6.9% of those in the sham-injected controls (P &lt; 0.005) (Figure 6, C and D). Thus, inhibition of GSK3 signaling attenuates NF-κB binding to cis-acting p65 binding elements by reducing NF-κB levels in the AD transgenic model mice in vivo. ARA reduced NF-κB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains.Figure 6ARA reduced NF-κB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains. APP23/PS45 mice were injected daily with ARA for 4 weeks, and whole brain lysates were subjected to EMSA. (A) Mice that received ARA had reduced intensity of NF-κB shifted band. n = 3. (B) Whole brain lysates subjected to EMSA was competed with 10- and 100-fold excess of the wild-type and mutant NF-κB oligos to demonstrate the specificity of binding. (C) Daily injections of ARA to APP23/PS45 mice for 6 weeks reduced NF-κB p65 levels in the whole brain lysates. (D) Quantification of the band intensity of NF-κB p65 levels. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. n = 25 total; *P &lt; 0.005. GSK3 inhibition reduces neuritic plaque formation in the AD model mice. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on AD pathogenesis, we treated APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice with ARA. The double transgenic mice develop detectable neuritic plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus as early as 1 month of age. The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. 4G8 immunostaining and thioflavin-S staining were used to detect Aβ-containing neuritic plaques in the brains (ref. 63 and Figure 7). ARA treatment significantly decreased the number of neuritic plaques in the transgenic mice relative to the vehicle-injected group (Figure 7, A and B). Quantification showed that overall ARA treatment reduced plaque number by approximately 50% (23.8 ± 4.7 vs. 10.4 ± 1.3 per slice, P &lt; 0.01) (Figure 7C). Thioflavin-S staining also confirmed that ARA treatment dramatically reduced the number of Aβ-containing neuritic plaques in the brains of APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice (Figure 7, D and E). The inhibitory effect of ARA was reversible, and the treated mice (Figure 7G) had plaque numbers similar to those in the control mice (Figure 7F) when examined 3 months after the end of the drug treatment (36.5 ± 5.1 vs. 32.1 ± 4.2, P &gt; 0.05) (Figure 7H). During the 4-week injection period, ARA treatment of the mice did not affect food consumption, and no significant weight changes were observed between the treatment and control groups (data not shown).

Inhibition of GSK3 significantly improves memory deficits in the AD model mice. To investigate whether GSK3 inhibition by ARA treatment affects the memory deficit in AD pathogenesis, we used the Morris water maze to test spatial memory after APP23/PS45 mice received 1 month of ARA treatment (64). In the visible platform tests, ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice had similar escape latency (42.4 ± 4.3 and 44.8 ± 2.7 seconds, P &gt; 0.05) (Figure 8A) and path length (6.6 ± 0.7 m and 6.1 ± 0.5 m, P &gt; 0.05) (Figure 8B), indicating that ARA treatment did not affect mouse mobility or vision. In the hidden platform test, ARA-treated mice showed significant improvements as compared with the vehicle-treated controls. The escape latency on the third and fourth days of the hidden platform test was shorter (12.0 ± 1.6 and 17.4 ± 3.1 seconds) than that of sham-treated mice (23.8 ± 4.0 s and 24.9 ± 2.7 s) (P &lt; 0.05, Figure 8C). The ARA-treated mice swam significantly shorter distances to reach the platform (2.9 ± 0.7 m and 3.2 ± 0.3 m) as compared with control mice (3.7 ± 0.6 and 4.2 ± 0.5 m) on the third and fourth days (P &lt; 0.05, Figure 8D). In the probe trial on the last day of testing, the platform was removed. ARA treatment significantly improved the spatial memory in the APP23/PS45 mice, as these mice spent more time searching for the platform in the appropriate quadrant (Supplemental Figure 3A). The number of times the mice traveled into the third quadrant, where the hidden platform was previously placed, was significantly greater with ARA treatment as compared with control (6.0 ± 1.0 and 2.0 ± 1.2 times, P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 8E). Moreover, ARA-treated mice spent nearly twice as long in the southwest (SW) quadrant, where the platform was originally placed during the hidden platform test (NE 16.3.9% ± 1.3%, SE 19.2% ± 1.6%, SW 44.0% ± 3.1%, NW 20.4% ± 2.0%). The sham-treated mice, however, spent approximately equal amounts of time in each quadrant (NE 24.9% ± 1.9%, SE 20.4% ± 2.0%, SW 28.2% ± 1.7%, NW 26.6% ± 2.1%) (Supplemental Figure 3B). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly improved the memory deficits seen in the AD model mice. ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice.Figure 8ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. A Morris water maze test consists of 1 day of visible platform trials and 4 days of hidden platform trials, plus a probe trial 24 hours after the last hidden platform trial. Animal movement was tracked and recorded by ANY-maze tracking software. APP23/PS45 mice at 6 weeks were injected daily for 1 month with ARA or a vehicle solution and subjected to the Morris water maze test (n = 26 mice total, 14 ARA-treated and 12 sham-treated).

GSK3 is involved in tau hyperphosphorylation (65), neuronal apoptosis (66), and synaptic dysfunction (67). Moreover, GSK3 signaling has also been implicated in Aβ production and neuritic plaque formation (51, 54, 68). However, the mechanism by which GSK3 affects APP processing and Aβ production has not been clearly elucidated, and its pharmaceutical potential as an effective drug target remains to be validated. The current study clearly indicates that GSK3β, but not the related GSK3α isoform, facilitates Aβ production by upregulating BACE1 gene expression via NF-κB p65 cis-acting elements on the BACE1 gene promoter. The C-terminal end of BACE1 undergoes phosphorylation, which regulates BACE1 trafficking and cellular levels (69, 70). In our study, inhibition of GSK3 signaling did not affect the phosphorylation status of BACE1 (data not shown). Thus, specifically inhibiting GSK3 decreases BACE1 expression and markedly reduces β-secretase processing of APP and Aβ production, resulting in inhibition of neuritic plaque formation and amelioration of memory deficits in AD model mice. GSK3 appears to be a common molecular link between amyloidogenesis and tau abnormalities in AD pathology. Therefore, GSK3 inhibition has been proposed to be a valid therapeutic target for treating AD. Lithium chloride and valproic acid are known to have some inhibitory effects on GSK3 (71, 72) and have been used in the clinic for many decades for the treatment of bipolar disorders and epilepsy. Recent work has demonstrated that lithium and valproic acid could reduce Aβ levels and improve cognitive performance in mouse models of AD (54, 68). While the inhibitory effects of lithium and valproic acid on GSK3 are known, both compounds have also been found to affect signaling cascades independent of GSK3. To further investigate the role of GSK3 on APP processing, we administered ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3 (IC50 = 104 ± 27 nM) (73) to APP Swedish stable cell lines and APP23/PS45 mice. We found that with specific GSK3 inhibition, the BACE1 major product C99 is reduced, accompanied by a significant reduction in Aβ levels. Previous reports indicated that ARA treatment reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation in transgenic mice overexpressing human tau, a model of AD (62). Our study shows that ARA also reduces plaque pathology and rescues cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. However, continuous ARA treatment is required in order to reduce plaque pathology, as APP23/PS45 mice sacrificed 3 months after the last injection had plaque levels similar to those in the control group. Previous work by Phiel et al. (51) demonstrated that inhibition of GSK3α with isoform-specific siRNA decreases γ-secretase activity but found no effect of GSK3β. In our study, we found that in a system in which γ-secretase activity is pharmacologically inhibited, GSK3α knockdown did not have any significant effect on APP processing. On the other hand, GSK3β knockdown with inhibition of γ-secretase activity reduced the level of C99 fragment, indicating that BACE1 activity is affected. We further provided evidence that knocking down GSK3β reduced BACE1 mRNA levels, but knocking down GSK3α did not affect BACE1 expression. Previous genetic studies have found that during development GSK3α could not compensate for the loss of GSK3β, as Gsk3b-KO mice are embryonic lethal while Gsk3a-KO mice are viable (61). This argues that GSK3α and GSK3β isoforms may have distinct cellular functions with respect to BACE1 expression. Moreover, GSK3β is the predominant isoform in the brain and therefore has been implicated in many CNS disorders (74). However, Jaworski et al. recently showed the GSK3α/β knockout mice did not show any changes to APP processing and Aβ production (52). This could be due to a physiological compensation of BACE1 expression in the KO mice compared with the acute effect of the GSK3 inhibitor. Additionally, our data showed that GSK3β regulated NF-κB–mediated BACE1 expression. Gsk3a knockout had no effect on NF-κB signaling. Taken together, these studies suggest that GSK3 isoforms have distinct roles in regulating APP processing. We do not believe that gene silencing of GSK3 isoforms would be a valid approach for treating AD. Complete ablation of each isoform may lead to compensatory elevated activity of the other isoform or even other functionally protein kinases. Moreover, it has been reported that complete ablation of GSK3α/β expression in mice results in various abnormalities (75), which may interfere with any therapeutic values. Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested a significant inflammatory component in AD (76–79). However, it remains controversial whether neuroinflammation is a driving force for AD or simply a byproduct of the disease (80). Moreover, the detrimental role of astrocyte and microglia during neuroinflammation remains elusive. The release of various proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been shown to affect APP processing, Aβ production, and neurodegenerative changes in AD brains. There have been preclinical studies to show that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anti-inflammatory cytokines have beneficial effects in treating AD (80, 81). However, there are reports demonstrating that anti-inflammatory stimuli could potentiate Aβ production, possibly through suppression of glia-mediated Aβ clearance. On the other hand, proinflammatory stimuli could also have extreme effects on AD pathogenesis. There is a large amount of evidence to show that increased proinflammatory cytokines correlates with Aβ production and neurodegeneration. In contrast, there are also a number of studies indicating that proinflammatory cytokines precondition the system for Aβ challenge and protect against neurodegeneration (82–85). Clearly, inflammation is a major component of the AD brain, and more work will be required in order to elucidate its role in AD pathogenesis. Since several proinflammatory cytokines including the interleukins and TNF have been found to activate GSK3β, and GSK3 inhibitors showed anti-inflammatory effects (86–88), we speculate that GSK3 plays an important role in the inflammatory response driving Aβ production. The chronic inflammatory response induced by Aβ may depend on transcription factors to exert neurodegenerative effects. Regulation of the transcription factor NF-κB and its transcriptional activity may in part play a role in Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration (27, 89). It has been previously reported that the BACE1 promoter contains NF-κB–binding elements (27, 90) and exacerbated Aβ levels modulate the BACE1 promoter activity via NF-κB–dependent pathways (91). More recently, Chen et al. (27) found increased NF-κB p65 and BACE1 expression in postmortem AD brains. Furthermore, overexpression of NF-κB p65 was found to increase human BACE1 promoter activity, whereas inhibiting NF-κB signaling reduced BACE1 expression (27). Exogenous application of Aβ has been found to increase GSK3β activity and NF-κB levels. There are many reports suggesting that GSK3β regulates gene transcription in an NF-κB–dependent manner (61, 92, 93). Therefore, we argue that the GSK3β/NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in regulating BACE1 gene transcription. In this study, we found that interfering with GSK3β activity using Gsk3b-KO cells or ARA treatment reduced BACE1 promoter activity and gene expression. Moreover, disrupting NF-κB expression also blocked GSK3β-induced BACE1 transcription. Long-term treatment with GSK3 inhibitors always raises the concern about unwanted side effects. Many of the Wnt signal transduction components such as the APC gene or β-catenin gene carry mutations that render the protein nondegradable (94). Prolonged activation of the Wnt pathway has been linked to development of various cancers (95). GSK3 inhibitors including SB216763, SB415286, Kenpaullone, and lithium chloride have all been shown to elevate the level of β-catenin (51, 96, 97). Consequently, it may be possible that GSK3 inhibitors may mimic Wnt signaling and could potentially be oncogenic. However, long-term use of lithium chloride to treat bipolar disorder has not been linked to increased risk of cancer. Interestingly, administration of the GSK3 inhibitors CHIR99021 and ARA did not change β-catenin levels (65). Moreover, β-catenin levels are largely unaffected in Gsk3b-KO embryos (61). These findings indicate that the inhibition of GSK3 by itself might not be sufficient to elevate the level of β-catenin. It is possible that there are specific pools of GSK3 that are insensitive to certain GSK3 inhibitors, thereby sparing the effect of increasing β-catenin levels. In order to validate the therapeutic efficacy of GSK3 inhibition, while minimizing oncogenic side effects, long-term treatment studies in cells and animals will be required. In conclusion, we have found that the GSK3β/NF-κB signaling pathway regulates BACE1 transcription and thereby facilitates Aβ production in AD. Since GSK3β and NF-κB are involved in AD pathogenesis, our results suggest that direct interference of this pathway may be a promising drug target for AD therapy. MethodsCell culture, transfection, and ARA treatment. All cells were maintained at 37°C in an incubator containing 5% CO2. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney), N2a (mouse neuroblastoma), SHSY5Y (human neuroblastoma), and wild-type MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were maintained in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Gsk3b-KO fibroblast cells were derived from E12.5 Gsk3b-KO mouse embryos and were maintained in complete DMEM (61). The 20E2 cell line is a Swedish mutant APP695 stable HEK293 cell line cultured in complete DMEM with 50 μg/ml geneticin (98). 293B2 cells stably expressing human BACE1 in HEK293 cell line were cultured in complete DMEM with 100 μg/ml Zeocin (99). The RelA-KO fibroblast cell line, derived from E12.5–E14.5 mouse embryo fibroblasts, was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, β-mercaptoethanol, and ESGRO (LIF) (100). S9A-GSK3β stably transfected SHSY5Y cells, under the control of the tetracycline-regulated mammalian expression T-Rex system (Invitrogen), were maintained in complete DMEM (60). S9A-GSK3β gene induction was achieved by stimulation with 1 μg/ml tetracycline (60). Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using either calcium phosphate or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). L685,458, G2, and ARA (EMD Biosciences) were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with complete cell culture medium. The final DMSO concentrations in each experiment were less than 0.5%. Luciferase assay. BACE1 promoter constructs were transfected into N2a cells and wild-type and Gsk3b-KO MEFs. The Renilla (sea pansy) luciferase vector pCMV-Rluc was co-transfected to normalize transfection efficiency. A luciferase assay was performed 48 hours after transfection with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) as previously described (27). Semiquantitative RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from cells using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). A Thermoscript Reverse Transcription kit (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA from an equal amount of RNA following the manufacturer’s instructions. The newly synthesized cDNA templates were further amplified via Platinum Taq DNA polymerase in a 20-μl reaction. The following primers were used to specifically amplify BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, APP, and PS1 genes: BACE1 forward 5′-cccgcagacgctcaacatcc and reverse 5′-GCCACTGTCCACAATGCTCTT; GSK3A forward 5′-TGAAGCTGGGCCGTGACAGCGG and reverse 5′-ACATGTACACCTTGACATAG; GSK3B forward 5′-TCAGGAGTGCGGGTCTTCCGAC and reverse 5′-CTCCAGTATTAGCATCTGACGCT; APP forward 5′-GCTGGCCTGCTGGCTGAACC and reverse 5′-GGCGACGGTGTGCCAGTGAA; PS1 forward 5′-GAGACACAGGACAGTGGTTCTGG and reverse 5′-GGCCGATCAGTATGGCTACAAA. β-Actin was used as an internal control. The samples were resolved and analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Immunoblot analysis. Brain tissues or cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with 200 mM sodium orthovanadate, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM PMSF, and a complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics). The samples were diluted in 4× SDS-sample buffer, boiled, and resolved on 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvindylidine fluoride (PVDF-FL) membranes. For immunoblot analysis, membranes were blocked for 1 hour in PBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C in primary antibodies diluted in the blocking medium. Rabbit anti-APP C-terminal polyclonal antibody C20 was used to detect APP and its CTF products. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. Total GSK3β was determined using a pan-specific mouse anti-GSK3α/β antibody (BioSource International Inc.). Total β-catenin was determined using a pan-specific rabbit anti–β-catenin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The NF-κB p65 subunit was determined using mouse anti-p65 (Sigma-Aldrich). Internal control β-actin was analyzed using monoclonal antibody AC-15 (Sigma-Aldrich). BACE1 was detected with the anti-BACE1 antibody 208 recognizing the C-terminal end (101). Aβ40/42 ELISA. HEK293 cells stably expressing the human APP gene containing the Swedish mutation were maintained in cell culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS. Following ARA treatment for 24 hours, conditioned medium was harvested, and protease inhibitors and AEBSF (Roche Diagnostics) were added to prevent degradation of Aβ peptides. APP23/PS45 double transgenic mouse cortical tissues were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions prior to carrying out the ELISA protocol (Invitrogen). The concentration of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detected using an Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 Colorimetric ELISA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. EMSA. Whole brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing the tissue in Buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor. EMSA was performed as previously described with a few changes (102). Briefly, 20–40 μg protein was incubated with an IRDye 700–labeled NF-κB oligo (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC), and the gels were scanned using the Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences). In the competition assay, unlabeled wild-type and mutant (5′-AGTTGAGGCCACTTTCCCAGGC) NF-κB oligos at ×10 and ×100 molar excess were used to compete for binding. Transgenic mice and drug treatment. APP23 mice overexpressing the Swedish APP751 (KM→NL) mutant transgene driven by the mouse Thy1.2 promoter were originally generated at Novartis Pharma as previously described (30, 103). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice were generated by crossing APP23 mice with mice overexpressing the human G384A-mutated PS1 under the control of the murine Thy1 promoter (B6,D2-TgN(Thy1-PS1G384A)45) (54, 103–105). APP23 and PS45 mice had been backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for more than 7 generations prior to breeding for the double transgenic mice. The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR using DNA from tail tissues. The treatment group contained 14 animals (8 females, 6 males), and the sham-injected group contained 12 animals (7 females, 5 males). The treatment group received 5 mg/kg ARA diluted in 0.9% saline daily via intraperitoneal injection at the same time each day. Mice in the control group were injected with the vehicle solution containing DMSO diluted in 0.9% saline only. We tabulated the daily food consumption and weight for each mouse. Immunohistochemical staining. Mice were sacrificed after behavioral testing, and half brains were immediately homogenized for protein, RNA, or DNA extraction. The other halves of the brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned with a Leica Cryostat to 30-μm thickness. Every twelfth slice with the same reference position was mounted onto slides for staining. Immunocytochemical staining was performed on floating sections. The plaques in the sections were detected with biotinylated monoclonal 4G8 antibody (Signetlabs) in 1:500 dilution, visualized by the ABC and DAB method, and counted under a ×40 objective as previously described (54, 63). Plaques were quantified, and the average plaque count per slice was recorded for each mouse. Thioflavin-S staining of plaques was performed with 1% thioflavin-S visualized using fluorescence microscopy (54). Morris water maze test. The Morris water maze test was performed as previously described (30, 64). The APP23/PS45 mice treated with or without ARA were subjected to the Morris water maze test 1 day after the last injection regimen. The test was performed in a 1.5-meter-diameter pool with a 10-cm-diameter platform placed in the SE quadrant of the pool. The procedure consisted of 1 day of visible platform tests and 4 days of hidden platform tests, plus a probe trial 24 hours after the last hidden platform test. In the visible platform test performed on the first day, the mice were tested for 5 continuous trials, with an inter-trial interval of 60 minutes. In the hidden platform tests, mice were trained for 5 trials, with an inter-trial interval of 1 hour. Each mouse was allowed 60 seconds to search for the platform. In the scenario where the mouse could not locate the platform, the experiment guided it to the platform and allowed the mouse to rest there for 15 seconds. On the last day of the test, each mouse was subjected to the probe trial in which the platform was removed. Each mouse was given 60 seconds to locate where the platform was originally placed. Mouse behavior including distance traveled, escape latency and the number of passes through the platform was recorded by automated video tracking (ANY-maze, Stoelting). The data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Statistics. All results were presented as mean ± SEM and analyzed by ANOVA or 2-tailed Student’s t-test. Statistical significance is accepted when P &lt; 0.05. Study approval.
